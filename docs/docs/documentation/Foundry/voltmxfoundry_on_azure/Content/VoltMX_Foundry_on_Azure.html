Overview
========

Volt MX  Foundry has multiple components, such as Identity, Integration, and Engagement Services. These features can be accessed through a common, centralized Volt MX Foundry Console. This document helps you install and configure Volt MX Foundry (Console, Identity Services, Integration Services, and Engagement Services) on Azure Cloud. For more information about Volt MX Foundry, refer to [VoltMX Foundry User Guide](/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/Introduction.html).

Volt MX  Foundry Containers on Azure Solution is designed to facilitate Volt MX Foundry on Azure for Non-Production and Production needs. This setup occurs with minimal manual intervention and leverages the following technologies:

*   **Docker** - To package different components as portable container images (with all the required binaries and libs)
*   **Kubernetes** - To orchestrate and maintain all these running containers. It will also have features like auto-scaling, secrets, deployment upgrades and rollbacks.
*   **Azure** - For provisioning of the underlying infrastructure.

From Foundry V9 SP1 onwards, the installation involves a separate dedicated cluster for Integration, which will be referred to as the **INT** cluster. Whereas, the rest of the Foundry components will be present in a single cluster which will be referred to as the **SHARED** cluster.

There are two installation modes, Production and Non-Production. The Production mode is equipped to handle Production level traffic and Non-Production mode is for testing purposes.

During the installation you would be prompted to choose between the installation of a Production instance or a Non-Production instance. In general, for a given Azure subscription an organization installs one Production instance and multiple Non-Production instances (for example, dev, qa, uat, etc.).

*   When you select a Non-Production instance, every time you run it to setup another environment such as qa, uat, etc., only the Integration (INT) cluster gets created again, while the rest of the Foundry components are shared for all the Non-Production instances within the subscription.
*   When you select a Production instance, each installation is treated as a fresh installation where both the Shared cluster and the Integration cluster will be created again.

> **_Note:_** In case of a Non-Production setup the information about the shared resources which are required for installing the new environments is stored as [installation metadata](Frequently_Asked_Questions__FAQs_.html#installation-metadata) in Azure Cosmos DB and Azure Key Vault.

 Salient Features

The Volt MX Foundry Containers on Azure Solution has the following features:

*   Creates a multi-layer architecture along with the Application Gateway in a Virtual Network making it secure.
*   Supports options to configure a custom DNS name, SSL cert support for secure communication, and includes Jumpbox for DevOps activities.

Overview for the Production and Non-Production Installations
------------------------------------------------------------

### Non-Production Mode

In a given Azure subscription, when you try to install a Non-Production instance, a complete Volt MX Foundry is created with both the clusters (Shared and Integration) for the first Non-Production installation. Subsequently, every time you run it to setup another non-production instance such as dev, qa, uat, etc., only the Integration (INT) cluster gets created again, while the rest of the Foundry components are shared for all the Non-Production instances within the same subscription. This integration instance is registered with the existing Foundry console created as part of the first installation.

### Production Mode

When you setup an Production account each installation is treated as a fresh installation where both the Shared cluster and the Integration cluster will be created for every install.

Prerequisites
-------------

1.  **Azure Account** - The setup script creates all the resources in this account. In your Azure subscription, your account should have the following permissions.
    
    
    <details close markdown="block"><summary>Azure Subscription Permissions</summary>
    
    *   Your account must have the role of an **[Owner](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/role-based-access-control/built-in-roles#owner)**.
    *   If your account has the role of a **Contributor**, you do not have adequate permissions. Contact your Azure Account Administrator for getting the required permissions.
    
    Steps to check the permissions of your Azure subscription:  
    
    a.  In the Azure Portal, select your account from the upper right corner, and select **My permissions**.  
        ![](/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmxfoundry_on_azure/Content/Resources/Images/AzureAcc_3.png)
    b.  From the drop-down list, select **Subscription**. Select **Click here to view complete access details for this subscription.  
        ![](/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmxfoundry_on_azure/Content/Resources/Images/AzureAcc_4.png)**
    c.  View the roles assigned to you. In the following image, the user has the role of the **Owner**, which means that the user has adequate permissions.  
        ![](/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmxfoundry_on_azure/Content/Resources/Images/AzureAcc_5_521x199.png)
    
    </details>

    <details close markdown="block"><summary>Azure Active Directory Permissions</summary>
    
    To check your Azure AD permissions:
    
    a.  Select **Azure Active Directory**.  
        ![](/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmxfoundry_on_azure/Content/Resources/Images/AzureAcc_1.png)
    b.  In Azure Active Directory, select **Overview** and look at your user information. You should have the role of a **Global Administrator** to proceed further. If you do not have this role, contact your administrator to assign this role to you.  
        ![](/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmxfoundry_on_azure/Content/Resources/Images/AzureAcc_2_525x185.png)
    </details>

2.  **Prerequisite packages** - The Volt MX Foundry Containers on Azure Solution does not need any additional software to be pre-installed, as the prerequisite packages are downloaded as a part of the setup scripts.

    **The packages that are installed as part of the install scripts are: azure-cli, kubectl, jq, and sponge.**

    > **_Note:_** To make sure that the script is able to download all the necessary software, you might need to open outbound connections to the respective sites. For more information, refer to the [Appendices](Appendices.html#appendices) section of this document.

3.  **Generate an SSH Public Key** – Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services. Volt MX Foundry setup expects an SSH key pair for authentication. The SSH public key is used for creating the Azure Virtual Machine, and for installing the Volt MX Foundry Setup. You need to specify the SSH Public Key in the properties file.
    
    On Ubuntu terminal, use the `ssh-keygen` command to generate SSH public and private key files that are created by default in the `~/.ssh` directory. This command can be executed from your local (Ubuntu) machine:
    
    `ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048` - This command is used to generate the SSH key pair using RSA encryption and a bit length of 2048. Name this key to be generated as **id\_rsa**.
    
    You must create and configure a key pair as you need to provide them in the [Configuration](#SSH) settings.
    
    > **_Note:_** The SSH keys need to be placed in **sshkeys** folder.
    
    > **_Note:_** You must leave the passphrase empty while generating the SSH key. VM logins are protected by other features such as the Google Authenticator.
    
4.  **Domain Name**\- You can have a Domain Name for the solution, which you can purchase from any third-party organizations, such as GoDaddy, and a proper DNS which you need to map to the public DNS of the Application Gateway. Refer to the [Appendices](Appendices.html#appendices) section, for more details.
5.  **SSL certs**\- To secure the communication, acquire the SSL certs (Azure Application Gateway requires certificates in .pfx format) and provide them during the Installation process. These SSL certs must be associated with the Domain Name that the user has procured. Refer to the [Appendices](Appendices.html#appendices) section on SSL cert pfx format conversion.
    *   Place the SSL certificate (in a **.pfx** file format) in the ssl-cert folder, and then provide the **Server Domain Name** and **AppGateway SSL Cert Password**.
    *   For enabling HTTPS on the back-end of appgateway, perform the following steps:
        1.  The SSL certificates with the cert data and key data should be in separate files (both in a **.pem** file format).
        2.  Save the Cert file as `ingress.pem`.
        3.  Save the Key file as `ingress_key.pem`.
        4.  Place both ingress.pem and ingress\_key.pem files in the **certs** folder of the installation directory.

    > **_Note:_** It is recommended to use CA signed SSL cert to avoid any errors.

    > **_Note:_** To execute the installation scripts, you must use Bash version 4 or later.

    > **_Note:_** In case you are using [Marketing Catalog Microservice](#marketing-catalog-microservice) or [Campaign Microservice](#campaign-microservice) you can refer to their prerequisites mentioned ahead in the document.

<details close markdown="block"><summary>Click here to view details of the User Defined Properties <strong>(Azure Subscription ID, Azure Service Principal ID Name, Azure Service Principal ID Secret, Service Principal Object ID, and Tenant ID)</strong></summary>

**Azure Subscription ID** is a GUID that uniquely identifies your subscription to use Azure services. The Application needs the Service Principal to access or configure resources through the Azure Resource Manager (ARM) in the Azure Stack.  
    You must have an Azure account with the permissions of a **Global Administrator** and the role of a **User**. Without these privileges, it is not possible to create the AKS clusters (or other resources).  
    The following section describes fetching **Azure Subscription ID**, generating **Azure Service Principal ID Name**, **Azure Service Principal ID Secret**, **Service Principal Object ID**, and **Tenant ID**.
<br>
i. **Steps to get the Subscription ID**

*   Navigate to [http://portal.azure.com/](http://portal.azure.com/).
*   Navigate to Browse.
*   In the search box, begin to type subscription.
*   Select Subscriptions from the search results.<br/>

Updating the Azure Kubernetes Service Cluster configuration
-----------------------------------------------------------

You need to have the current config files if you want to update the AKS cluster configuration. Once the installation is complete, take a backup of the unzipped directory where you installed the `voltmx-foundry-containers-azure.zip` to perform further updates to the AKS clusters.

> **_Important:_** If you do not have a backup of the unzipped directory, updating the AKS cluster is difficult.

Setting up Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN)
-----------------------------------------------

A Content Delivery Network (CDN) is a distributed network of servers that can efficiently deliver web content to users. To minimize latency, CDNs store cached content on edge servers in Point-Of-Presence (POP) locations that are close to end users.

Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) offers a global solution for developers to rapidly deliver high-bandwidth content to users by caching the content at strategically placed physical nodes across the world.

> **_Note:_** Azure CDN SKU for AKS cluster is set to Premium Verizon, which supports configuration of cache rules for Volt MX Foundry Apps.

Configuring Clam AntiVirus for Azure Virtual Machines
-----------------------------------------------------

Clam AntiVirus (ClamAV) is an open-source anti-virus software toolkit. You can choose to install ClamAV on Azure Virtual Machines in the kubernetes cluster. ClamAV is designed to be an on-demand scanner, and will only run when invoked to run.

A cron job is configured to run ClamAV on Azure Virtual Machines based on the frequency specified in the properties file. ClamAV scans all the files in the virtual machine and pushes the logs (**clamscan.log** and **freshclam.log**) present in **/var/log/clamav** directory to the **clamavlogs** container in the **storage account** of the Azure Resource Group in which the AKS cluster is created.

Provide the following inputs in the properties file to enable ClamAV.

### Install ClamAV on Azure Virtual Machine

Follow these steps to install ClamAV on your Azure Virtual Machine:

1.  Set the value of `INSTALL_CLAMAV` to `true` in the properties file (trail.properties /enterprise.properties).
2.  Place your SSH private key and SSH public key in the `sshkeys` folder with names **id\_rsa** and **id\_rsa.pub** respectively.
3.  Set the frequency of the cron job to start the ClamAV scan and push the generated logs to the storage account.

> **_Note:_**  Use the following format to set the values for the frequencies of `clamscan_cron_schedule` and `clamscanlogpush_cron_schedule` in the properties file (trail.properties /enterprise.properties).
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-voltmx" data-lang="voltmx"> * * * * *
  |  |  |  |  |
  |  |  |  |  |
  |  |  |  | +---- Day of the Week   (range: 1-7, 1 standing for Monday)
  |  |  | +------ Month of the Year (range: 1-12)
  |  | +-------- Day of the Month  (range: 1-31)
  | +---------- Hour (range: 0-23)
  +------------ Minute (range: 0-59)
 * = any value</code></pre></figure>


For example, if you configure the crontab timing as 00 16 \* \* \*, this indicates that the crontab runs every day at 16:00:00 (UTC).

*   You must maintain a minimum gap of 02:30 hrs. between the `clamscan_cron_schedule` and `clamscanlogpush_cron_schedule`.
*   All cron job timings follow UTC timezone.

### Access ClamAV logfiles in the Virtual Machine

Follow these steps to access the ClamAV logs in the Virtual Machine.

*   Log on to Jumpbox using the following ssh command:  
    `ssh devops@<Jumpbox_Public_IP_Address>`
*   Log on to the Virtual Machine from Jumpbox using the following SSH command:  
    `ssh -i id_rsa azureuser@<Virtual_Machine_IP_Address>`
*   Using the following command, go to `/var/log/clamav` directory:  
    `cd /var/log/clamav`

This directory contains the `clamscan.log` and `freshclam.log` files that are generated by ClamAV after scanning the Virtual Machine.

Another cron job is configured to push the generated logs into the Azure Storage Account.

### Edit the cron job

*   Use the following command to view existing cron jobs on the VM.  
    `crontab -l`
    
    ![](/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmxfoundry_on_azure/Content/Resources/Images/ClamAV/CLAMAV1.png)
    
*   Use the `crontab -e` command to open the crontab list in edit mode.  
    

### Edit the ClamAV conf file

Configuring OSSEC Intrusion Detection
-------------------------------------

OSSEC is an open source Host-based Intrusion Detection System (HIDS). It has a powerful correlation and analysis engine, and can perform integrating log analysis, file integrity checking, Windows registry monitoring, centralized policy enforcement, rootkit detection, real-time alerting, and active response.

OSSEC runs as a daemon process. It notifies through alert logs when intrusion attacks occur. These alert logs are pushed to the **osseclogs** container in the storage account in the Azure Resource Group in which AKS cluster is created.

Provide the following inputs in the properties file to enable OSSEC.

### OSSEC Installation steps

1.  Enable the `INSTALL_OSSEC` flag in the properties file (trial.properties /enterprise.properties):
    
    ![](/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmxfoundry_on_azure/Content/Resources/Images/ClamAV/OSSEC1.png)
    
2.  As OSSEC is a daemon process, it continuously detects intrusion activities and stores alerts in `alerts.log` file. A cron job is configured to push the alerts from `/var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.log` to the Azure Storage Account.

> **_Note:_** Configure the `cronjob osseclogpush_cron_schedule` in the properties file (trail.properties /enterprise.properties) to set the frequency value of the cron job. Configure the Crontab timing in the following format:
<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-voltmx" data-lang="voltmx"> * * * * *
  |  |  |  |  |
  |  |  |  |  |
  |  |  |  | +---- Day of the Week   (range: 1-7, 1 standing for Monday)
  |  |  | +------ Month of the Year (range: 1-12)
  |  | +-------- Day of the Month  (range: 1-31)
  | +---------- Hour (range: 0-23)
  +------------ Minute (range: 0-59)
 * = any value</code></pre></figure>


For example, if you configure the crontab timing as 00 16 \* \* \*, this indicates that the crontab runs every day at 16:00:00 (UTC).

*   You can modify the default values of the cron job, if required.
*   All cron job timings follow UTC timezone.

3.  Place your SSH private key in the sshkeys folder with name id\_rsa.

### Access log files of OSSEC in Virtual Machine

Follow these steps to access OSSEC logs in the Virtual Machine.

1.  Use the following SSH command to log on to Jumpbox
    
    `$ ssh devops@<Jumpbox_Public_IP_Address>`
    
2.  Use the following SSH command, to log on to the Virtual Machine from the Jumpbox
    
    `$ ssh -i id_rsa azureuser@IPaddress of Virtual Machine`
    
3.  Execute the following command to login as a root user.
    
    `$ sudo su`
    
4.  You can view the **syslogs** at `/var/log/syslog`.
    
    `$cd /var/log/`
    
    `$cat syslog`
    
5.  Logs created by OSSEC daemons are stored in the sub directories of `/var/ossec/logs`.
    
    *   You can view the OSSEC logs at `/var/ossec/logs/ossec.log`
        
       `$cd /var/ossec/logs/`
        
       `$cat ossec.log`
        
    *   You can view the OSSEC alerts at `/var/ossec/logs/alerts/alerts.log`.
        
       `$cd /var/ossec/logs/alerts/`
        
       `$cat alerts.log`
        

### Edit cron jobs

*   To view the existing cron jobs use the following command on VM.
    
    $ crontab -l
    
    ![](/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmxfoundry_on_azure/Content/Resources/Images/ClamAV/OSSEC2.png)
    
*   Use the `crontab -e` command to open the crontab list in edit mode.

Marketing Catalog Microservice
------------------------------

The Marketing Catalog Microservice is a comprehensive source of system-independent data of product details and marketing content crossing all the banks products, and capable of consuming products and services outside of the bank. Examples include products offered by FinTechs (such as payment devices) or real banking products that can be sold and marketed on behalf of other banks. Banks can choose to ingest the product details from the existing core or Product management system. This can be created and managed in the Marketing Catalog microservice.

### Prerequisites

*   Run the installation on a fresh virtual machine.
    
    > **_Important:_** If in case you execute the file on an existing virtual machine you must ensure the Java is not installed on it or pointing it to Java 8 is mandatory.
    
*   Create a cluster in your Atlas account and **Allow access from anywhere** in the IP access list which is present under Network Access. Then, create a database user for your cluster and connect it to your cluster. Refer to [Get Started with Atlas](https://docs.atlas.mongodb.com/getting-started/) for the exact procedure that needs to be followed to execute this step.
    
    > **_Important:_** You must ensure allowing access from anywhere in the IP access list of the cluster. To do so you must login to your cluster and under Network Access go to IP Access List and then click on **Edit** and select **Allow access from anywhere** then save.
    
    ![](/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmxfoundry_on_azure/Content/Resources/Images/NetworkAccess.png)
    
*   Install mongo shell of the same version as that of the cluster version. If your cluster version is 4.2.10 as shown in the following image then you must install mongo shell of version 4.2.10.

![](/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Foundry/voltmxfoundry_on_azure/Content/Resources/Images/marketingmicroservice.png)

### Deployment

*   If you want to create the marketing catalog microservice resources along with the end to end installation of Volt MX Foundry on Azure cloud you must do the following:
    1.  Provide the required inputs in the `conf/enterprise.properties` file.
    2.  Execute the `install-foundry.sh` file.
*   If you want to create only the marketing catalog microservice resources then do the following:
    1.  Copy the `marketing_catalogs` folder from VoltMXFoundryContainersAzure-\_/lib/microservices/ path.
    2.  Provide the required inputs in the `conf/ marketing_catalog_ms.properties` file.
