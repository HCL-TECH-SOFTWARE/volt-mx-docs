When do I use a Menu?

You can use a Menu in the following scenario:

    For example, in an Retail Application, you can have menus showing various segments of products. You can add number of menu items on a MenuBar.

##### Adding a Menu from IDE

The steps involved in adding a Menu widget are as follows:

To use Menu in an application, follow these steps:

1.  Go to **Applications view**.
2.  Expand the application for which you want to use Menus.
3.  Navigate to **forms > desktop**, right-click **desktop** and select **New Form**. The **Create a New Form** window appears.
4.  Enter a name for the Form and click **Finish**. A new form is created.
5.  Drag-drop a MenuBar on the form.
    
    The MenuBar should not be placed at the bottom of the Form because the menu always expands downwards. If still want to place the menu at the bottom of the form, ensure that you have enough space to view the items when the menu is expanded.
