VoltMX Foundry License
===================

The license for VoltMX Foundry can be obtained as a separate license key, by sending a request to your sales representative. The license requests are classified as mentioned below:

*   [New license request](#new-license-request) - If you are using the VoltMX product for the first time, you can make this request.
*   [License renewal request](#license-renewal-request) - If your existing license is close to expiration, you can make this request.
*   [License re-issue request](#license-re-issue-request) - If your existing valid license is lost, you can make this request.
