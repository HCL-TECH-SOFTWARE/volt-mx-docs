=====================================

This document explains how to use the Box-to-flex Converter Tool. The Free Form FlexContainer, a new layout container introduced by VoltMX, helps you to design your UI, animations, and gestures faster than before. The existing Box layout in VoltMX Iris has several restrictions, which limit UI designers to explore multifaceted design scenarios.

The Box-to-Flex Converter tool enables you to leverage capabilities of the new flex widget in your existing box-based applications. Currently, you cannot use both Box and Flex layout widgets together. This may force you to redesign an entire application. The redesign process results in costs in terms of efforts and money.

To address these redesign issues, we have developed a new tool to help you convert your existing box-based applications to flex-based in minutes. This helps to avoid days’ worth of effort by many application developers.
