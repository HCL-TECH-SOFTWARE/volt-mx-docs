## Volt MX App

The Volt MX App is the companion mobile app to the Volt MX cloud service. The app enables you to utilize and manage a set of capabilities related to Volt MX Iris and Volt MX Foundry services offered as part of Volt MX.

Not only you but others can also preview the mobile apps built by you while giving the flexibility to update them on the go. You can generate various reports and manage your Volt MX Foundry cloud accounts using the app. It was primarily created to ease the workflow between a designer and a developer but has now evolved into a much more feature rich app that takes care of most of your app development needs including reports and metrics.

The Volt MX App is available for iOS and Android platforms. You can find the application on the App Store and the Google Play Store.
