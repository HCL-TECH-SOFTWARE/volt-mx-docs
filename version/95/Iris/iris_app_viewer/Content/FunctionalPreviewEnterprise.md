===============================================

Using the Volt MX App, you can view the front-end prototype of a project on a device. You can run any action attached to a form or widget such as navigating from one form to another, executing events of the forms, and applying a skin to a widget.

You can make changes to your project and then incrementally preview those changes, you can see those changes reflected in a local preview of the app on your device. For the [incremental preview](#Incremental_Preview) you must set the Volt MX App on your device to do so, as described later in this topic.

> **_Note:_** The Volt MX App does not support the display of Cordova Browser widget in the 7.1.1 version of App User Guide.

> **_Important:_** Incremental preview is supported only for local preview of projects. For previews published to the cloud, the project must do a full **Preview > Publish**; incremental previewing is currently not available for the cloud.

This section provides the following documentation on Previewing an App:

Preview an App Locally
----------------------

Runs the Volt MX App for a prototype by using the device on which you have App User Guide installed, to act as the host for displaying the app on your device. You can connect your device by either by using a wireless connection or, starting from App User Guide version 7.3, via a USB connection.

A French version of the Volt MX App is available. To view the Volt MX App in French, set your device's language to French (and for Apple devices, also set the region to France), and then restart the Volt MX App.

*   [Preview an App by using a USB Connection](#preview-an-app-by-using-a-usb-connection)
*   [Preview an App by using a Wi-Fi Connection](#preview-an-app-by-using-a-wi-fi-connection)

### Preview an App by using a USB Connection

When you preview an app locally, use your App User Guide computer to act as the host for displaying the app on your device via a wireless or USB connection. This procedure assumes that you have already generated a preview on App User Guide and that both your computer and your mobile device have a wireless or USB connection. For more information, see [Generate a Preview of the App](#generate-a-preview-of-the-app).

![](Resources/Images/App_Viewer/USB_202x358.png)

> **_Note:_** To connect to an Android device via a USB connection, the device must have Android version 5.0 or later.

> **_Note:_** To connect to an iOS device via a USB connection, the device must have iOS version 10 or later.

> **_Important:_** **USB Tethering for iOS devices on Windows Machine**:  
**Prerequisites** - Ensure that the latest version of iTunes is installed on the Windows machine. Before you start viewing the app on your iOS device by using the USB feature on the Volt MX App, open iTunes on your Windows machine.
