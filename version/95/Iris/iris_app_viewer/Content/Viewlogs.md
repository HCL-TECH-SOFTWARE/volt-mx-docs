============================

Logs on a device provide a detailed view of all the actions executed on the child app that is previewed using the Volt MX App. Logs on the device give developers a better debugging experience of the app usage.

Once you launch the child app using the Volt MX app on your device, you can access real-time logs on the app viewer. By using the View logs option, you can Volt MX APIs. In addition to viewing logs, you can also share, copy, clear, and download the logs.

The logs are two types, **Full Logs** and **Print logs**.

The Print logs display logs that are filtered by the features defined by the Developer. Full logs display content that is both defined by the developer as well as other functions that came predefined from Volt MX Iris.

Logs help developers to record the exact sequence of events that occurred while the app was running. With the **Print** logs option on the device, the developer can view the print logs. If the developer wants to view more info on logs, the developer can use the **Full logs** feature.

*   Using [view logs](#view-logs), you can view every action happening in the backend. It helps you to track the program execution in the backend.
*   Using [share the logs](#share-the-logs), you can share the logs with the pre-installed applications that are available on your device. You and the team can gain a better understanding of the actions executed on the app.
*   Using [copy the logs](#copy-logs-to-console), you can copy the logs and paste the logs in your Notepad or an equivalent app on your device.
*   Using [clear the logs](#clear-the-logs), you can clear the logs on the device. It helps you to improve the performance of the app.
