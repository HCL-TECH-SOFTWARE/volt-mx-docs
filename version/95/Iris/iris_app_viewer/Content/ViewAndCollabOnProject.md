# Preview and Collaborate on a Project

The Volt MX App provides an easy way of sharing designs with your stakeholders in a secure environment.

Ways of viewing your app and collaborating with your stakeholders are:

- [Preview an App on a Device](FunctionalPreviewStarter.md): Using the Volt MX App, you and your stakeholders can preview the project you built as a functional app on their devices.
- [Execute App Lifecycle Events](ExecuteChildAppEvents.md): You can execute any action events attached to the widgets in your application.
- [Notes in Volt MX App](Notes.md): Stakeholders can add notes to the different forms (i.e. screens) of the app, which you can then view in App User Guide.
- [Previewing Apps with NFIs/FFIs in Volt MX App](Previewing_Child_Apps_with_FFIs_in_App_Viewer.md); In general, you cannot use NFI/FFI based apps in native store (Google Play or AppStore) applications. However, you can run NFI/FFI based apps using the **Preview** feature of Volt MX Iris.

Additionally, if you have published a preview to the cloud, a publish code is generated. This publish code can be used for others to use and view your app. You can clear that publish code so that it is no longer applicable to that preview. For more information, see [Clear the Publish Code for a Project's Preview](ClearThePublishCodeForAppPreview.md#ClearThePublishCodeForAppPreview.md).

Also, if you need to know about the default Cordova plugins, see [Default Cordova Plugins for Volt MX App](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/CreateCordovaApplications.md#default-cordova-plugins-for-volt-mx-app).
