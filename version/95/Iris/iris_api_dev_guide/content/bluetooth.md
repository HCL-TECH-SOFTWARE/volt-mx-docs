============================

Bluetooth APIs allow a mobile device to scan other devices, connect, and wirelessly exchange data with other Bluetooth devices. These APIs let applications wirelessly connect to other Bluetooth devices, enabling point-to-point and multipoint wireless features.

This API is pre-bundled with Iris Classic and does not need to be explicitly imported. Enable this API from Project properties before using.

> **_Important:_** This API is available on Android platform only.

Using the Bluetooth APIs, an Android application can perform the following:

*   Scan for other Bluetooth devices.
*   Identify paired Bluetooth devices.
*   Establish Radio Frequency Communication (RFCOMM) channels.
*   Connect to other devices through service discovery.
*   Transfer data to and from other devices.
*   Manage multiple connections.
