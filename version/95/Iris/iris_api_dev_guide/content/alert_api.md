Alert API
=========

Volt MX  Alert API enables you to configure and send alerts to an application. Alert APIs draw the attention of the user to take some action or to provide the user some information.

There are three types of Alert messages:

*   **Confirmation** type alerts display confirmation messages with Yes and No options on the screen.
*   **Info** type alerts display informative messages on the screen. This message can in turn be a warning or a success message.
*   **Error** type alerts display error messages on the screen.

When alerts appear in an app, the user cannot proceed with other UI operations unless they dismiss the alert.

When an alert appears, the user must take some action on the alert. The user cannot proceed with any other operation without responding to the alert first. Alert API uses `voltmx.ui Namespace` and contains the following function.

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [voltmx.ui.Alert](voltmx.ui_functions_alert.md#window.a) | Provides you the ability to add alerts in the application. |
