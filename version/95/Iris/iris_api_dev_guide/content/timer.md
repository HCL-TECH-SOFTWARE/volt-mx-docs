Timer API
=========

The Timer API helps you to schedule the execution of functions after configured time intervals.

The Timer API consists of the `voltmx.timer Namespace` and the following API elements:

  
| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [voltmx.timer.cancel](voltmx.timer_functions.md#volt-mx-timer-cancel) | Cancels the timer that has already been scheduled for execution. |
| [voltmx.timer.setCallBack](voltmx.timer_functions.md#volt-mx-timer-setcallback) | Specifies the callback function that needs to be executed for a scheduled timer. |
| [voltmx.timer.schedule](voltmx.timer_functions.md#volt-mx-timer-schedule) | Executes the given function after a specified interval of time. |

Â 

Schedule the execution of functions using the [voltmx.timer.schedule](voltmx.timer_functions.md#volt-mx-timer-schedule) function. You can override the callback function of the scheduled timer and set a new callback function using the [voltmx.timer.setCallBack](voltmx.timer_functions.md#volt-mx-timer-setcallback) function. Use the [voltmx.timer.cancel](voltmx.timer_functions.md#volt-mx-timer-cancel) function to cancel the execution of a scheduled timer.

To view the functionality of the Timer API in action, download the sample application from the link below. Once the application is downloaded, build and preview the application using the Volt MX App.
