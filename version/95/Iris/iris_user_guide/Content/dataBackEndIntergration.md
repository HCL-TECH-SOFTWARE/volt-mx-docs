# Data and Backend Integration

### [Introduction to Data Panel](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/DataPanel.md)
Leverage the multitude of features of the Data panel in Volt MX Iris to link back-end data services to your application's user interface elements seamlessly with low-code to no-code. Use the sample services in the Data panel to bind back-end services to your apps and test the user interface.

### [Connect to Services](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Connecting_to_Services.md)
Understand how to enable your application to execute transactions or exchange data with any external data source. Volt MX Iris provides out-of-the-box support for connecting to a Web Service and an XML Service.

### [Add a Local Database to an App](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/AddALocalDatabaseToAnApp.md)
Bundle an SQLite database into an app so that the data in the database is always available locally on whatever device the app is installed on. This capability can be used to store something as simple as a collection of website favorites to a more complex data, such as a product catalog.
