=====================

As you create an app and add functionality to it, you may want to incorporate code or other data that resides in a file located outside the project you're working on. With Volt MX Iris, you can open such files so that you can copy the data you need and add it to your app.

To open a file that is external to your current project, do the following:

1.  On the **Project** menu, click **Open File**.
2.  Navigate to the file you want to open, and then click **Open**. The file opens on the Iris Canvas.
3.  Select the portion of the file that you want, and then from the **Edit** menu, click **Copy**.
4.  Open the asset where you want to paste the data you copied, place the insertion point where you want to paste, and then from the **Edit** menu, click **Paste**.
