=================

Responsive design enables developers to create applications that can fit their contents based on the form factor of the device. Using Volt MX Iris, you can develop Mobile (Native and Adaptive Web), Tablet (Native and Adaptive Web), and Responsive Web applications, that are responsive in nature.

*   **Responsive Grid Layout**: Using the Responsive Container, a developer can define the elements in a flex container on a form to suit various form factors. You can use the Responsive Containers on Mobile (Native and Adaptive Web), Tablet (Native and Adaptive Web), and Responsive Web channels.
*   **Responsive Web Design**: Available only on the Responsive Web channel, the Responsive Web Design allows you to design a responsive web app with customizations that you can apply at a deeper level. For more information, click [here](Responsive_Design_8_2.md).

Overview
--------

Responsive Grid Layout provides a quick and convenient way to create responsive apps for the Web, Tablet, and Mobile channels (including Portrait and Landscape mode). Using Responsive Grid Layout, you can customize the UI to create flexible, multi-column layouts that use breakpoints. The Responsive Grid Layout reduces the time taken to implement Responsive properties for Container and child widgets as there are fewer properties that require fewer code changes.

To support the Responsive Grid Layout, a new Layout Type, **Responsive Grid**, has been added to the Container widgets such as, **Flex Form**, **FlexContainer**, and **FlexScrollContainer** widgets.

The Responsive Grid layout divides the container widget into columns based on the value of the **Span** property. The maximum number of columns is twelve. The Span property sets the width of the child widget based on the 12-column layout. The **Offset** property determines the position of the left edge of the widget. This position is measured either from the left edge of the parent widget or from the right edge of the widget present to its left.

> **_Note:_** If the value of Span + Offset is more than 12, the next child widget that you add is wrapped and appears in a row below the current row.

The columns of the Responsive Container resize and re-arrange automatically depending on the Screen size. The following table displays the size () width of the child widget for different span values.

When the Responsive Grid Layout is applied to a container widget, the child widgets of the Responsive Container will have a new section in the Look tab, **Responsive Configuration**, that has the **Span** and **Offset** properties specified for each breakpoint.

You can only add FlexContainer widgets as child widgets in a Responsive Container. Within the Responsive Container, the child FlexContainer can have its own child widgets nested, as long as the Layout Type for the FlexContainer widget (child of the Responsive Container) is not Responsive Grid. Accessing child widgets of a Responsive Container through code is similar to accessing child widgets in other FlexContainers.

> **_Note:_** Duplicate widgets cannot be placed in Responsive Containers.

> **_Note:_** You can only configure transformational animation for the direct child widgets of a Responsive Container.

Span and Offset properties override the positional and width properties of direct child widget. Therefore, in addition to the Span and Offset properties, you can only configure the following Flex properties for the child FlexContainer widget of the Responsive Container:

*   Height
*   Min Height
*   Max Height
*   Z Index

Responsive Container for Web
----------------------------

When a Responsive Container is added to a Form in the Responsive Web channel, you might observe the following:

*   In the Responsive Configuration section, default breakpoints of 640, 1024, and 1366 are added for Web apps. However, you can modify and delete these breakpoint values and also add new values.
*   When a new breakpoint is added, all child widgets of the Responsive Container support the new breakpoint. In such cases, widgets will be populated with the closest smaller breakpoint span and offset values to the newly-created breakpoint.
*   If a breakpoint is modified, all FlexContainer widgets present in the Responsive Container will reflect the modified breakpoint with the same span and offset values that were set to it earlier.
*   When a breakpoint is deleted, the breakpoint will be removed from all child widgets.
*   Breakpoint forking is not supported for FlexContainer widgets present within the cells of a Responsive Container. However, the child widgets in those FlexContainer widgets support breakpoint forking.

**General Steps to implement Responsive Grid Layout for Mobile & Tablet apps**

The process of using Responsive Grid Layout for Mobile or Tablet includes the following broad steps:

*   Create a Form and configure the Orientation property as both (Portrait and landscape).
*   Add a FlexContainer or FlexScrollContainer based on your requirements.
*   Configure the Layout Type of the container as Responsive Grid.
*   Add child container widgets as required.
*   Modify the Span and Offset values of the child widgets for Portrait and Landscape orientations.
*   Build and view the app.

**General Steps to implement Responsive Grid Layout for Responsive Web/Desktop Web apps**

The process of using Responsive Grid Layout for Web apps include the following broad steps:

*   Create a Form and define the breakpoints or use the default breakpoints.
*   Add FlexContainer widgets based on your requirements.
*   Configure the Layout Type of the container as Responsive Grid.
*   Add child container widgets as required.
*   Modify the Span and Offset values of the child widgets for different breakpoints.
