==================================

In Volt MX Iris, you can add native function APIs for use with native UI widgets. These native UI widgets are platform-specific widgets to either iOS or Android, and can be used in an application by placing them in a native UI container widget called a NativeContainer. A native UI container can only be used for native UI widgets; it cannot contain any Volt MX Iris cross-platform widgets. For more information, see [Using the Native UI Container](NativePlatformWidgets.md).

To add native function APIs, do the following:

1.  On the **Edit** menu, click **Manage Native Function API(s)**. The Native Function Interface dialog box displays, and lists any native APIs you have already added or imported into the project.
2.  Click the platform you want to download an API for, either iOS or Android.
3.  Click **Add**. Volt MX Iris retrieves a list of native APIs available for the platform you chose.
4.  In the Search text box, type keywords that help narrow the scope of the APIs listed.
5.  From the list, select an API you want, and then click **Add**.
6.  Repeat steps 3 through 5 until you have added all the native APIs you want.
7.  When you are finished adding native APIs, close the dialog box by clicking the **X** in the upper right corner.
