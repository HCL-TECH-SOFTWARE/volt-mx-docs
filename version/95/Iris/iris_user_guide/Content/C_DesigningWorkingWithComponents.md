Creating Applications With Components
=====================================

_Components_ help you quickly develop sophisticated applications with dynamic, responsive user interfaces across multiple channels â€” phones, tablets, wearables, and desktops. You can use components as building blocks for rapid application development without having to write all the code yourself.

For example, you can build your applications from a rich assortment of components created by the HCL Forge Assets team and other developers. These components are available for download from [HCL Forge](http://community.hclvoltmx.com/marketplace) :

You can also build your own reusable components to use in your applications or publish to HCL Forge .

Components are an extension of _masters_ in earlier versions of Volt MX Iris. You can continue to use existing masters or import other masters into your applications as components.

The following topics describe how to create digital applications with components:
