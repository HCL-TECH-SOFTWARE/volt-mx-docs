Volt MX  Iris
------------------

This user guide provides documentation for Volt MX Iris which is free to download and use, is an integrated, intuitive development environment for prototyping and building omni-channel digital applications—all from a single code base. Volt MX Iris , is integrated with Volt MX Foundry, giving you the ability to create robust back-end services for powerful, scalable, omni-channel, enterprise-wide digital app solutions.

Widgets — the building blocks of your digital app
-------------------------------------------------

Within Volt MX Iris's visual environment, you piece together discrete functional building blocks called widgets. Widgets range from the simple, such as a button or input field, to the complex, such as a Cordova Browser widget, or a 3D image with complex rotation and transform animations. All widgets have attributes and properties that you configure to suit the needs of your app, such as excluding or including a given widget based upon which device the app runs on.

Skins, Themes, and Components
-----------------------------

To give your app a particular look, feel, and set of behaviors native to a platform, you can use ready-made skins. You can customize these to make them your own, or build them from scratch. You can even group skins together as a collection called a _theme_ to maximize visual uniformity across devices. To reduce your app development time, you can create components to group and configure user interface elements and action sequences in a single definition, and then instantiate them anywhere throughout an application. You can publish your components on HCL Forge , or download third-party components from HCL Forge and use them in your applications.

Back-end services
-----------------

To integrate your apps with back-end services, Volt MX Iris communicates directly and securely with your existing data system, writing the connection once and then applying it to all devices. Volt MX Iris also supports multiple classes for generating markup based on device capabilities, and devices can receive WML, cHTML or a combination of XHTML, CSS, and JavaScript based on capabilities detected at runtime.
