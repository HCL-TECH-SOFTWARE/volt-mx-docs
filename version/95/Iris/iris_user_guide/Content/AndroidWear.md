============

Android Wear (now called Wear OS) is a version of Google's Android Operating system designed for smart watches and other wearables. Android Wear pairs with devices running on Android 4.3 or newer and iOS version 8.2 or newer phones. You can use Android Wear to perform functions such as calling, text messaging, and receiving notifications. Watch face styles include round and square. Volt MX Iris supports Sony SmartWatch 3 (320 x 320), Android Wear (400 x 400), and Android Wear (480 x 480).

Ensure that you configured Android Wear properties in Project Settings. For more information, see [Android Wear Properties](AndroidWear_Properties.md).

The following are the main features of an Android Wear:

*   [Forms](#forms)
*   [Form Properties](#form-properties)

Forms
-----

A form is the starting point for any application and is the top most container. A form can contain any number of widgets but cannot contain another form.

Your Android Wear app can consist of multiple forms, and you can move from one form to another using a couple of different methods. You can use an action sequence, such as assigning the **Navigate to Form** action to a button so that, when it is clicked, it displays a different form.

#### Add an Android Wear Form

**To add an Android Wear form to the Iris canvas, follow these steps:**

1.  Open Volt MX Iris.
2.  From the **Project** menu, select **New Project**Â or **Open** > <_your Project name_\>.  
    Your project opens.
3.  In the Project tab, expand the **Wearables** folder.  
    The Wearables folder expands displaying its contents.
4.  Expand the **Android Wear** folder.  
    The Android wear folder expands displaying its contents.
5.  Click on the down-arrow next to **Forms**.  
    A list appears.
6.  Select **New Form** from the list.  
    A new form is created with a default name.
7.  If you want to rename the form, click on the down-arrow next to the form and then click **Rename**.  
    Rename the form.

#### Mark as StartUp

Mark as StartUp functionality is used to make a form function as the app's start up form. The form that is a marked as start up is the first form to appear after the application is loaded.

**To mark a form as the start up form, follow these steps:**

1.  In your Iris project, in the Project tab, expand the **Wearables** folder.
2.  Expand the **Android Wear** folder.  
    The Android wear folder expands displaying its contents.
3.  Expand the **Forms** folder.  
    All forms available in the folder appear.
4.  From the list, select the form you want to choose as the startup form.
5.  Click on the down-arrow next to the form and select **Mark as StartUp**.

> **_Note:_** By default, the first form is considered as the start up form until another form is specifically marked as start up.

#### Add a Widget to a Form

To add a widget to a form, do the following:

1.  From the **Default Library** pane of Volt MX Iris, drag the required widget and drop it on a form on the Iris Canvas.
2.  A new widget with a default name/ID is added to the form.
3.  You may choose to rename the widget by changing its **ID** in the **Look** tab under the **Properties** pane of Volt MX Iris or right-click the widget name in the **Project** tab and then click **Rename**.
4.  Save the form.

The following widgets are supported on an Android Wear form:

<table style="mc-table-style: url('Resources/TableStyles/Basic.css');margin-left: 0;margin-right: auto;width: 532px;" class="TableStyle-Basic" cellspacing="0"><colgroup><col style="width: 114px;" class="TableStyle-Basic-Column-Column1"> <col style="width: 146px;" class="TableStyle-Basic-Column-Column1"> <col style="width: 129px;" class="TableStyle-Basic-Column-Column1"> <col style="width: 139px;" class="TableStyle-Basic-Column-Column1"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1" data-mc-conditions=""><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">FlexContainer</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">FlexScrollContainer</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Tab</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyD-Column1-Body1">TabPane</td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1" data-mc-conditions=""><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Button</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Calendar</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">CheckBoxGroup</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyD-Column1-Body1">DataGrid</td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1" data-mc-conditions=""><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Image</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Label</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Listbox</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyD-Column1-Body1">RadioButtonGroup</td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1" data-mc-conditions=""><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">RichText</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Slider</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">TextArea</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyD-Column1-Body1">TextBox</td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1" data-mc-conditions=""><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Map</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Phone</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">PickerView</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyD-Column1-Body1">Segment</td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1" data-mc-conditions=""><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyB-Column1-Body1">Switch</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyB-Column1-Body1">Video</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyB-Column1-Body1">&nbsp;</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyA-Column1-Body1">&nbsp;</td></tr></tbody></table>

#### Open the Assets Folder

**To navigate to the location where the form assets are available on your computer, do the following:**

1.  Click on the down-arrow next to the form whose assets folder you want to view.  
    A drop down menu appears.
2.  Select **Resource Location** from that drop down.

##### Android Wear OS

  
| Property | Definition | Action |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Soft Input Mode** | This property defines how the main Form interacts with the window containing the on-screen soft keyboard. It determines the adjustments made to the Form whether it is resized smaller to make room for the soft keyboard or whether its contents pan to make the current focus visible when part of the Form is covered by the soft keyboard. Â  | You can choose between **Adjust-Pan** and **Adjust-Resize**. **FORM\_ADJUST\_RESIZE**: Specifies the form is resized and when you click or start typing within the widget which requires an input, the form scrolls up and the widget which requires an input is not overlapped by the keypad or footer. **FORM\_ADJUST\_PAN**: Specifies the widget which requires an input is placed at the bottom of the popup is overlapped by the keypad. The main Form is not resized to make room for the soft keyboard. Rather, the contents of the Form are automatically panned so that the current focus is never obscured by the keyboard and users can always see what they are typing. This is generally less desirable than resizing, because the user may need to close the soft keyboard to get at and interact with obscured parts of the Form. |
| **Dismiss on Edge Swipe** | Using this feature, you can enable or disable dismissing forms by swiping at the edge. | You can turn it **On** or **Off**. |
