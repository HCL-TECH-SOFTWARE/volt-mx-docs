-------------------------

| US-ASCII | Encoding scheme based on the sequence of characters in the English alphabet |
| UTF-16 | 16-bit UTF encoding scheme |
| UTF-16BE | UTF 16 bit Big Endian. Encoding scheme that maps Unicode character set to a sequence of 2 bytes (16 bits) |
| UTF-16LE | UTF 16 bit Little Endian. Encoding scheme that maps Unicode character set to a sequence of 2 bytes (16 bits) |
| Windows-1250 | Encoding scheme (under Microsoft Windows) for languages that use Latin script |
| Windows-1251 | 8-bit encoding scheme for languages that use Cyrillic alphabet |
| Windows-1252 | Encoding scheme for the Latin alphabet |
| Windows-1253 | Encoding scheme for modern Greek language |
| Windows-1254 | Encoding scheme for Turkish language |
| Windows-1255 | Encoding scheme for Hebrew language |
| Windows-1256 | Encoding scheme for Arabic language |
