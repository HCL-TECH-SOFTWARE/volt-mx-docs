----------------------------------------------------------

A Volt MX Iris Reference Architecture project lets you create a custom application using a structured, modular framework based on the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture. Forms represent the _view_ of the application, and there is a _controller_ associated with each form that manipulates the view, handles navigation, and interacts with a statically defined _model_ or dynamic object services layer.

You can use the **New Project** wizard to create a custom Volt MX Iris Reference Architecture project, a custom Free Form JavaScript project, or a project that is built from sample applications and components. For information on the different types of Volt MX Iris projects, see [Types of Projects](TypesOfProjects.md).

To create a new custom Volt MX Iris Reference Architecture project, follow these steps:Â 

1.  Click the **Project** menu, and then click **New Project**. The **What do you want to start with now?** screen of the **New Project** wizard appears.
2.  You can choose to create any one of the following types of apps:


    *   **Web App**: Click **Web App**,and then click **Next**.

    *   **Native App**: Click **Native App**,and then click
         **Next**.

3.  Perform these steps for the following types of apps:


    *   **Web App**: Select the channel for which you want to create a Web app: Desktop, Tablet, or Mobile. Here, **Mobile**. Click **Advance Project Settings**.

     > **_Note:_** By default, the **VoltMX Iris Reference Architecture** option is auto-selected in the **Select project type** window.


5.  In the **Project Name** box, type the name of the project.
    *   **Web App**

     > **_Note:_** A project name must contain fewer than 18 characters. You cannot use any special characters or spaces in the project name.

     > **_Note:_** A project name can be alphanumeric. However, the first character of a project must be an alphabet.

     > **_Note:_** Do not use any of the following reserved keywords as a project name: authService, workspace, mfconsole, vpns, middleware, accounts, syncservice, syncconsole, services, admin, middleware, and appdownload.  

6.  Click **Create**. Volt MX Iris creates a Volt MX Iris Reference Architecture project with folders for forms, popups, templates, modules, resources, actions, and services. For a Volt MX Iris Reference Architecture application project, Volt MX Iris also creates a **Controllers** folder.

When you create a form or template, Volt MX Iris automatically creates associated _controller_ and _controller actions_ modules in the **Controllers** folder, using the form name as a prefix. When you rename the form or template, Volt MX Iris automatically updates the names of the associated modules to use the new form or template name.
