-----

Use a Phone widget to launch the native phone dialer and initiate a phone call to a specified phone number. When a user clicks the Phone widget, the native dialer launches to make a call.

To learn how to use this widget programmatically, refer [VoltMX Iris Widget guide](../../../Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/Phone.md).

### Look Properties

Look properties define the appearance of the widget. The following are the major properties you can set:

*   Whether the widget is visible.
*   The platforms on which the widget is rendered.
*   How the widget aligns with its parent widget and neighboring widgets.
*   If the widget displays content, where the content appears.

For descriptions of the properties available on the Look tab of the Properties pane, see [Look](Look.md#Flex).

### Skin Properties

Skin properties define a skin for the widget, including background color, borders, and shadows. If the widget includes text, you can also specify the text font.

For the Phone widget, you can apply a skin and its associated properties for the following states:

  
| Skin | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Normal | The default skin of the widget. |
| Focus | The skin applied when the widget has the focus. |

For more information about applying skins, see [Understanding Skins and Themes](Customizing_the_Look_and_Feel_with_Skins.md).

### Phone Properties

On this tab, you can assign properties that are run on any platform (which is supported by Volt MX Iris) and also, assign properties specific to a platform.

### Actions

Actions define what happens when an event occurs. On a Phone widget, you can run an action when the following events occur:

*   onTouchStart: The action is triggered when the user touches the touch surface. This event occurs asynchronously.
*   onTouchMove: The action is triggered when the touch moves on the touch surface continuously until movement ends. This event occurs asynchronously.
*   onTouchEnd: The action is triggered when the user touch is released from the touch surface. This event occurs asynchronously.

For more information, see [Add Actions](working_with_Action_Editor.md).

### Placement Inside a Widget

The following table summarizes where a Phone widget can be placed:
