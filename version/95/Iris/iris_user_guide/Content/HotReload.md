===================

Starting with  release, Volt MX Iris has introduced the Hot Reload feature in live preview. The Hot Reload feature improves the Live preview experience within Volt MX Iris by reducing the build and preview time of a live preview.

Using the Hot Reload key, developers can view their changes immediately, adjust their UI as required and fix any code issues. Developers can also build their UI incrementally by viewing their changes in the live preview using the Hot reload feature. The Hot reload feature also reduces the application build time. Earlier, to view changes in the live preview, developers always had to build the application.

While in the Iris canvas, you can use the Ctrl+Shift+R combination to invoke the Hot reload feature in the Live Preview window.

Limitation of Hot Reload
------------------------

*   Hot reload is only supported for MVC applications, changes are reflected in forms and controllers.
*   Hot Reload support only on the responsive web. This is to avoid any release mode security issues.
    
*   Hot reload works only on a top-level form that you are viewing.
    
*   If you make any changes to your Volt MX Foundry, the Hot Reload feature will not work. If foundry app changes are made, then you need to re initiate the preview.

    *   i18N resources
    *   Themes
    *   Custom widgets
