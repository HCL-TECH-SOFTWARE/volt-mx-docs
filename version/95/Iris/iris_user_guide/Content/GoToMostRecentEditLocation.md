===================================

As you design an application, you may frequently switch between code modules, forms, and action sequences, making it challenging to return to the JavaScript file where you had last been coding. With Volt MX Iris, doing so is easy. The Last Edit Location feature returns you to the last JavaScript file you edited, even if it's currently closed.

To go to the most recent edit location, do the following:

*   On the **Edit** menu, click **Last Edit Location**. Volt MX Iris displays the most recently edited JavaScript file from the **Module** section of the **Project** tab in the Project Explorer, placing the insertion point at the row and character position of the last keystroke you entered.

> **_Note:_** You can also press **Ctrl + Q** (**Alt + Q** on the Mac).
