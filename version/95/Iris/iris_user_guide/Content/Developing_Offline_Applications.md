===============================

Offline Applications enable you to access services on your device if it is not connected to a network (data). This basically provides you with the flexibility to define a service for your application which can be accessed by the user when the device is not connected to a network. You can access the following Data sources offline by using the Volt MX Sync tool chain View.

*   Sky Data Objects
*   Databases
*   Web Services
*   SAP Services
*   Siebel Services
