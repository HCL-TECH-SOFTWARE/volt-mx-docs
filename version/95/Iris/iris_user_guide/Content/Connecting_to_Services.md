===================

A _Service_ is an application component that represents the application's interaction with the external service data source. A service definition comprises the metadata or the configurations required to exchange data with the external data source. For example, the configurations can be: service type, service ID, input parameters, output parameters, [pre and post processors](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/Java_Preprocessor_Postprocessor_.md), target URL, authentication credentials (if required), and type (HTTP/HTTPS).

You can define the services for the following connectors:

*   XML over HTTP
*   Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP)
*   Java - Custom connector for any other data source
*   Composite - A combination of all the above
