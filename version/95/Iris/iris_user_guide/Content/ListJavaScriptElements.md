==========================================

When you are editing a JavaScript file in the Code Editor, Volt MX Iris gives you the ability to display a list of the code elements in that file, in the order that they appear. These code elements include globally available objects, functions, arrays, numbers, and strings. By double-clicking a code element in the list, the insertion point navigates to that code element.

> **_Note:_** This functionality does not apply to popups or code snippets.

**_Notes:_***   The listed results are drawn form the last saved instance of the JavaScript. Any unsaved code is not reflected in the results.
*   This functionality does not apply to popups or code snippets.

To display a list of code elements in a JavaScript file, do the following:

1.  Open a JavaScript file in the Code Editor. To do so, in the Project Explorer, on the **Projects** tab, expand the **Modules** section, and then click the JavaScript file you want to open.
2.  Press **Ctrl+O** ( ⌘ + O on the Mac). A list of code elements displays.
3.  Navigate to any code element by double-clicking it from the list.
