Calendar Events
===============

Calendar widget has the following events associated with it:

* * *

<details close markdown="block"><summary>doLayout Event</summary>

* * *

This event is invoked for every widget when the widget position and dimensions are computed.

### Syntax

```

doLayout()
```

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

This event is invoked for all the widgets placed inside flex containers. This event is invoked in the order in which the widgets are added to the widget hierarchy and expect the frame property of the widget is calculated and available for use within this event.

This event is used to set the layout properties of child widgets in the relation to self and peer widgets whose layout is not yet performed.

The number of times this event invoked may vary per platform. It is not recommended to write business logic assuming that this function is invoked only once when there is a change in positional or dimensional properties. This event will not trigger when transformations are applied though widget is moved or scaled or rotated from its original location.

### Example

```

//Sample code to set doLayout event callback to a button widget.
/*This code changes the top property of button2 and makes it appear below button1.*/
myForm.button1.doLayout=doLayoutButton1;


function doLayoutButton1(){
      
    myForm.button2.top = myForm.button1.frame.height;
}
```

function onScrollWidgetPositionCallBack(wdg, screenX, screenY, frameX, frameY) { //wdg : Widget that is registered for onScrollWidgetPosition.
    /*screenX : Position of widget with respect to 
the screen's X - coordinates (after downsizing the navigation bar and status bar).*/
    /*screenY : Position of widget with respect to the screen's Y - 
coordinates (after downsizing the navigation bar and status bar).*/
