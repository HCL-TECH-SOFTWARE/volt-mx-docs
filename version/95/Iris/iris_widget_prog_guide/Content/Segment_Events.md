==================

The SegmentedUI widget has the following events associated with it:

* * *


<details close markdown="block"><summary>doLayout Event</summary>

* * *

This event is invoked for every widget when the widget position and dimensions are computed.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

doLayout()
```

<b>Read/Write</b>

Read + Write

<b>Remarks</b>

This event is invoked for all the widgets placed inside flex containers. This event is invoked in the order in which the widgets are added to the widget hierarchy and expect the frame property of the widget is calculated and available for use within this event.

This event is used to set the layout properties of child widgets in the relation to self and peer widgets whose layout is not yet performed.

When doLayout event is called in a Segment, the platform will add the context parameter.

The number of times this event invoked may vary per platform. It is not recommended to write business logic assuming that this function is invoked only once when there is a change in positional or dimensional properties. This event will not trigger when transformations are applied though widget is moved or scaled or rotated from its original location.

<b>Example</b>

```
//Sample code to set doLayout event callback to a button widget.
/*This code changes the top property of button2 and makes it appear below button1.*/
myForm.button1.doLayout=doLayoutButton1;


function doLayoutButton1(){
      
    myForm.button2.top = myForm.button1.frame.height;
}
```

<b>Read/Write</b>

Read + Write

<b>Remarks</b>

This event is not raised if the **clickable** property in the **metainfo** is set to false.

In the Android platform, when a gesture or touch events are placed inside the flex template for the Segment widget, because of the propagation of events to the below container, the flex template may not receive onRowClick event.

<b>Example</b>

```
//Sample code to set onRowClick event callback to a Segment widget.

frmSegment.mySegment.onRowClick=onRowClickCallBck;

function onRowClickCallBck(seguiWidget, sectionNumber, rowNumber, selectedState)
{
	//Write your logic here
}
```

<b>Platform Availability</b>

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>onRowDisplay Event</summary>

* * *

This event handler is used to overwrite the rows that are affected because of an operation on rows.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

onRowDisplay()
```

<b>Read/Write</b>

Read + Write

<b>Parameters</b>

widget

Optional. The IDÂ of the widget.

state

Optional. The state of the widget. Can be voltmx.segment.ADD, voltmx.segment.UPDATE, or voltmx.segment.VISIBLE.

currentRowContext

Optional. The sectionIndex and rowIndex of the element on which the animateRow api is called.

startRowContext

The sectionIndex and rowIndex of the first visible row.

endRowContext

Optional. The sectionIndex and rowIndex of the last visible row.

Return Values

None.

<b>Remarks</b>

This event overwrites the animations of rows that are being affected by operations on rows. For example, when the addRowAt is called with animation, this callback would be invoked when the animation on the row is about to start, so that other animations can be applied to the remaining rows.

Your callback function for this event should only call animateRows. It should call the animation on the individual row elements. For example, if a new element is being added and if the application needs to move the elements which are being displaced with an animation, then the application should be calling animationRows for the displaced elements but not for the widget which is being added/removed or updated.

This callback function is only invoked if the state of the segmentedUI widget changes in the visible region. It is not called on rows that are invisible.

<b>Example</b>

```
//Sample code to set onRowDisplay event callback to a Segment widget.

frmSegment.mySegment.onRowDisplay=onRowDispCallback;

function onRowDispCallback(widget, state, currentRowContext, startRowContext, endRowContext)
{
	//Write your logic here
}

<b>Remarks</b>

The onScrollEnd callback is called asynchronously. This event is called only when the scrolling reached end of the scroll.

When multiple scrolls performed on the Segment widget, the onScrollTouchReleased is triggered whenever touch is released, but the onScrollEnd event is triggered only when the entire scrolling is ended. So when the user keeps on flinging on the display, the onScrollTouccReleased callback is triggered multiple times and onScrollEnd is triggered only once.

<b>Example</b>

```
//Sample code to set onScrollEnd event callback to a Segment widget.

frmSegment.mySegment.onScrollEnd=onScrollEndCallBack;

<b>Read/Write</b>

Read + Write

<b>Remarks</b>

This is applicable only for Mobile Web channel. The function must exist in a javascript file under project>module>js folder.

In for the events preOnclickJS and postOnclickJS you will not be able to access application model or APIs, as these functions are executed in browser whereas the remaining JS modules are executed in server. For these events you can access browser objects ( window, document etc..) to change UI or perform some validation before server event. If the event preOnclickJS returns true, only then the request is sent to server for subsequent action.  
  
You have to specify the modules to be loaded in browser using import JS tab, only then these files get included in.html script tag otherwise you will not be able to access the objects defined in those modules.

<b>Example</b>

```
//Sample code to set preOnclickJS event callback to a Segment widget.
