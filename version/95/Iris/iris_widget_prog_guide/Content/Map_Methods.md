===========

The Map widget has the following methods associated with it:

* * *


<details close markdown="block"><summary>addCircle Method</summary>

* * *

This method is used to add a circle to the map widget with the given location data.

### Syntax
```

addCircle(circleData)
```

### Parameters

circleData

Specifies the location data for which the circle is drawn on the map. Parameters of the circleData are:

> *   **id** \[String\] \[Mandatory\]: Specifies the unique identifier to represent the circle. If a circle already exists with the same identifier, then it gets replaced by the new id.
>     
> *   **centerLocation** \[JSObject\] \[Mandatory\]: Specifies the center location for circle. This property takes the same keys of locationData property of map. Center location of the map is represented with the Map pin.
>     
> *   **radius** \[Number\] \[Mandatory\]: Specifies the radius in meters.
> *   **navigateAndZoom** \[Boolean\] \[Optional\]: Decides whether the navigation to first pin should take place. It is available on Android, Windows, and iOS. The default value of this parameter is true.  
     Here is an example of how to enable this property.
```

      locationData: [{
       lat: "17.445775",
       lon: "78.3731",
       name: "Campus 1",
       desc: "My Office Campus",
       navigateAndZoom: true
     }]
     };
 ```    
> *   **showCenterPin** \[Boolean\] \[Optional\]: Indicates whether to show pin image for Circle center location. Default value is true.
> *   **circleConfig** \[JSObject\] \[Optional\]: Specifies an object with predefined configuration keys. These configuration keys can hold platform specific keys as well. The following is the list configuration keys:
> 
> *   **lineColor** \[String\] \[All\]: Specifies the color of the circle border line in RBGA hex format. Default line color in RGBA is FF0000FF (RED). For example, 0xFF0000FF and FF0000FF, both formats are valid for Red color. The RGBA format followed is of standard RGBA format; it is not same as the RGBA color code generated by Volt MX Iris IDE for skins. If the lineColor is not specified in proper format, it falls back to the default behavior.
> *   **fillColor** \[String\] \[All\]: Specifies the color that circle area is filled with in RBGA hex format. The format could be 0xRGBA or RGBA. No fill color is applied by default. For example, 0xFF0000FF and FF0000FF, both formats are valid for Red color. The RGBA format followed is of standard RGBA format; it is not same as the RGBA color code generated by Volt MX Iris IDE for skins. If the fillColor is not specified in proper format, it falls back to the default behavior.
> *   **lineWidth** \[Number\] \[All\]: Specifies the width of the circle in screen independent pixels. Default line width is 3 dp.
> *   **lineDashPattern** \[Array\] \[iOS\]:An array of numbers specifying the dash pattern to use for the path.
> 
> *   **zIndex**\[Number\] \[Optional\]: Applicable for Android and iOS platforms.  
>     Specifies the stack order of circles added in the Map widget. In Android platform, you can set a Double or Integer value (including negative value) as `zIndex`. In iOS platform, you cannot set a negative value to this parameter. When a circle(or any shape like polyline, polygon etc.) is added to the Map widget with a higher `zIndex`, it will be placed in front of the other circles (or other shapes) with lower zIndices. The default value of this parameter is zero.
>     
>     > **_Note:_** In Android platform, in a map the z-index value stack of the pins are different from the z-index stack of the shapes. The pins are drawn on top of the shapes based on their z-index values. Also, when the pins and shapes (such as circle and polyline) are placed on the map on top of each other, the click event of the pins have a higher priority than the click events of the shapes.
>     

Return Values

None

When a pin is added to the Map widget with a higher `zIndex`, it will be placed in front of other pins with lower zIndices. If multiple pins are placed at the same co-ordinates, then the [onPinClick](Map_Events.md#onPinCli) event is first triggered for the pin with a higher `zIndex`. The `onPinClick` event is then triggered for the rest of the pins in a descending order of `zIndex` on consecutive clicks. The default value of this parameter is zero.
    
    > **_Note:_** In Android platform, in a map the z-index value stack of the pins are different from the z-index stack of the shapes. The pins are drawn on top of the shapes based on their z-index values. Also, when the pins and shapes (such as circle and polyline) are placed on the map on top of each other, the click event of the pins have a higher priority than the click events of the shapes.

*   sectionIndex \[number\] : section index of the segui where gesture was recognised. (Applicable to gestures added to segUI rows)

It is not recommend to define gestures for widgets that have a default behavior associated with it.

If you click (tap) a button (any clickable widget), the default behavior is to trigger an onClick event. If you define a Tap gesture on such widgets, the gesture closure is executed in addition to the onClick event.

If you swipe a larger form, the default behavior is to scroll up and down depending on the direction in which you swipe. If you define a SWIPE gesture on such forms, the gesture closure gets executed in addition to scrolling the form.

If you swipe a Segmented UI with huge number of rows, the default behavior is to scroll the Segmented UI. If you define a SWIPE gesture on such segments, the gesture closure gets executed in addition to scrolling the form.

Gestures can be added only for the following widgets:

*   Flex Container
    
*   Flex Scroll Container.
    

In the android platform, the top and bottom gestures work only when the scrolling is disabled for Form and parent scrolling containers. By default, the scrolling is enabled for the Form and scrolling containers.

*   RIGHTTAP applicable only to Windows 10
*   ROTATION is not supported on android.

### Example

```

//Sample code to add Gestures to the frmGestures FlexForm.
//Code to add DOUBLE TAP gesture to the frmGestures, FlexForm.
var doubletp = {
 fingers: 1,
 taps: 2
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(1, doubletp, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add SINGLE TAP gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var singleTp = {
 fingers: 1,
 taps: 1
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(1, singleTp, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add SWIPE gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var swipeForm = {
 fingers: 1,
 swipedistance: 50,
 swipevelocity: 75
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(2, swipeForm, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add LONGPRESS gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var longPressForm = {
 pressDuration: 2
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(3, longPressForm, onGestureFunction);

* * *

This method is used to add a polygon to the map widget with the given location data.

### Syntax
```

addPolygon(polygonData)
```

### Parameters

polygonData

Specifies the location data for which the polygon is drawn on the map. Parameters of the polygonData are:

*   **id** \[String\] \[Mandatory\]: Specifies the unique identifier to represent the polygon. If a polygon already exists with the same identifier, then it gets replaced by the new id.
*   **locations** \[Array\] \[Mandatory\]: Specifies the list of all the locations as an array. Each location object accepts "lat" and "lon" keys and other keys are ignored. First and last location in the list are connected even if they are not same.
*   **navigateAndZoom** \[Boolean\] \[Optional\]: Decides whether the navigation to first pin should take place. It is available on Android, Windows, and iOS. The default value of this parameter is true.  
    Here is an example of how to enable this property.
```

     locationData: [{
      lat: "17.445775",
      lon: "78.3731",
      name: "Campus 1",
      desc: "My Office Campus",
      navigateAndZoom: true
    }]
    };
```  
    
*   **polygonConfig** \[JSObject\] \[Optional\]: Specifies an object with predefined configuration keys. These configuration keys can hold platform specific keys as well. The following is the list configuration keys:

*   **lineColor** \[String\] \[All\]: Specifies the color of the polygon border line in RBGA hex format. Default line color in RGBA is FF0000FF (RED) . For example, 0xFF0000FF and FF0000FF, both formats are valid for Red color. The RGBA format followed is of standard RGBA format; it is not same as the RGBA color code generated by Volt MX Iris IDE for skins. If the lineColor is not specified in proper format, it falls back to the default behavior.
*   **fillColor** \[String\] \[All\]: Specifies the color that polygon area is filled with in RBGA hex format. The format could be 0xRGBA or RGBA. No fill color is applied by default. For example, 0xFF0000FF and FF0000FF, both formats are valid for Red color. The RGBA format followed is of standard RGBA format; it is not same as the RGBA color code generated by Volt MX Iris IDE for skins. If the fillColor is not specified in proper format, it falls back to the default behavior.
*   **lineWidth** \[Number\] \[All\]: Specifies the width of the polygon in screen independent pixels. Default line width is 3 dp.
*   **innerPolygons** \[Array\] \[Android, iOS\]: Specifies the list of all the locations as an array to draw inner polygon without fill color. Each location object accepts "lat" and "lon" keys and other keys are ignored. First and last location in the list are connected even if they are not same. If the inner polygons falls beyond outer polygon region, the behavior of the outer and inner polygon may vary in underlying platforms. In Android, fill color of the outer polygon may be not applied properly and in iOS, inner polygons may be applied the fill color.
*   **lineDashPattern** \[Array\] \[iOS\]:An array of numbers specifying the dash pattern to use for the path. The array contains one or more numbers that indicate the lengths (in dp) of the line segments and gaps in the pattern. The values in the array alternate, starting with the first line segment length, followed by the first gap length, followed by the second line segment length, and so on.
*   **isDashedLine** \[Boolean\] \[ Windows\] - Boolean property to indicate whether to draw border line in dashed format

*   **zIndex**\[Number\] \[Optional\]: Applicable for Android and iOS platforms.  
    Specifies the stack order of the polygons drawn on the Map widget. In Android platform, you can set a Double or Integer value (including negative value) as `zIndex`. In iOS platform, you cannot set a negative value to this parameter. When a polygon is added to the Map widget with a higher `zIndex`, it will be placed in front of the other polygons (or any shape like polyline, circle, etc.)with lower zIndices. The default value of this property is zero.
    
    > **_Note:_** In Android platform, in a map the z-index value stack of the pins are different from the z-index stack of the shapes. The pins are drawn on top of the shapes based on their z-index values. Also, when the pins and shapes (such as circle and polyline) are placed on the map on top of each other, the click event of the pins have a higher priority than the click events of the shapes.

<details close markdown="block"><summary>animate Method</summary>

* * *

Applies an animation to the widget.

### Syntax
```

animate (animationObj, animateConfig, animationCallbacks)
```

### Parameters

_animationObj_

An `animation` object created using [voltmx.ui.createAnimation](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/voltmx.ui_functions.md#createAn?TocPath=References|voltmx.ui_Namespace|Functions|_____5) function.

_animationConfig_

As defined in widget level animation section.

_animationCallbacks_

A JavaScript dictionary that contains key-value pairs. The following keys are supported.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| animationEnd | A JavaScript function that is invoked with the animation ends. For more information, see the **Remarks** section below. |
| animationStart | A JavaScript function that is invoked with the animation starts. For more information, see the **Remarks** section below. |

### Return Values

Returns a platform-specific handle to the animation. This handle currently not used, but is returned for possible future requirements use.

### Remarks

The callback for the `animationStart` key in the JavaScript object passed in this method's _animationCallbacks_ parameter has the following signature.

animationStart(source, animationHandle, elapsedTime);

where `source` is the widget being animated, `animationHandle` is the handle returned by the `applyAnimation` method, and `elapsedTime` is the amount of time the animation has been running in seconds, when this event is fired..

This event occurs at the start of the animation. If there is 'animation-delay' configured then this event will fire only after the delay period. This event gets called asynchronously.

The callback for the `animationEnd` key in the JavaScript object passed in this method's _animationCallbacks_ parameter has the following signature.

animationEnd(source, animationHandle, elapsedTime);

where source is the widget being animated, animationHandle is the handle returned by the applyAnimation method, and elapsedTime is the amount of time the animation has been running in seconds, when this event is fired.

This event occurs at the end of the animation. This event gets called asynchronously.

The `animate` method throws an Invalid Animation Definition Exception if animation definition, does not follow the dictionary structure expected. This method is ignored if it is called on a widget whose immediate parent is not FlexContainer or a FlexScrollContainer.

If the widget is not part of the currently visible view hierarchy, calling this method does nothing. Because this method is asynchronous and immediately returns, it does not wait for the animation to start or complete.

### Example

```

//Sample code of animation
function AnimateBoth() {
    var getFuncName = frm1.listbox18.selectedKey;
    if (getFuncName == "BothLT") {
        frm1.textbox26.animate(myAnimDefinition(),
            animConfiguration(), {});
    } else if (getFuncName == "BothTBL") {
        frm1.textbox26.animate(myAnimDefinitionsc1(),
            animConfiguration(), {});
    }

<details close markdown="block"><summary>clone Method</summary>

* * *

When this method is used on a container widget, then all the widgets inside the container are cloned. This method takes an optional parameter. If the widgetid is not passed then the cloned copy will have the same ID as original widget.

If the widget ID is passed as a parameter then it will be prefixed to the existing ID and will assign it to cloned copy of the container. For all other widgets of the container and its child widgets.

For example, if the widget ID is "fc1" and the widget ID passed to clone API is "ref1", then the cloned widget ID will be "ref1fc1". For a child widget placed in a container with widget ID as "wid1", the cloned copy will have the widget ID as "ref1wid1".

Exceptions are not displayed if widget ID parameter is not unique. Instead when the cloned copy is added to the same form as of original container then it may lead to unexpected behaviors. So it is your responsibility to provide unique widget ID.

### Syntax
```

clone()
```

### Parameters

widgetId \[String\]

Optional. Reference of the name of the widget.

### Return Values

Cloned copy of the widget.

### Exceptions

None

### Remarks

*   This method is not supported on SegmentedUI2 widget.
*   Gestures for the FlexContainer are not cloned. You have to reapply the gestures on the cloned object.
*   In Android platform, cloned Map widget will not work if prefix is not passed as parameter to the API.

*   To apply focusSkin for dynamically created widgets or cloned widgets, assign focusSkin dynamically after adding the widget to the form hierarchy. This is applicable for SPA and Desktop web platforms.
```

    formid.widgetid.focusSkin = "skinname";
```
*   To apply hoverSkin for dynamically created widgets or cloned widgets, assign hoverSkin dynamically after adding the widget to the form hierarchy. This is applicable for the Desktop web platform.
```

    formid.widgetid.hoverSkin = "skinname";
```

### Example

```

//This is a generic method that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the clone Method for a FlexContainer widget.
//You need to make a corresponding call of the clone method for other applicable widgets.  
var flex2 = frmFlex.flexContainer1.clone();
//Here, flexContainer1 is a FlexContainer widget that is already present in frmFlex FlexForm.
frmFlex.add(flex2);
//For instance, the corresponding clone method call on the Label widget is as follows:
var myLabel=frmFlex.lbl1.clone();

    var previewInfoTable = {
        "peekForm": frmSecond,
        "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
        "contentSize": [320, 480]
    };
    return previewInfoTable;
}
```

onPopCallback (Optional)

A callback function that is invoked when the user further presses (hard press) the preview that is displayed for the widget.

Callback Syntax

onPopCallback(widget,peekForm)

Callback Input Parameters

_widget_

A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

_peekForm_

A form reference that is displayed as preview/peek.

### Callback Return Values

  A form reference.

### Callback Remarks

Use this callback to set the content for pop. The form handle returned by this callback is used for pop content. In general, the form that is used for preview is used for pop content also. If the pop callback is not implemented, peek disappears and the app returns to its previous state.

### Callback Example

```

function onPopCallback(widget, peekForm) {
    // preview form used for pop also
    return peekForm;
}
```

### Remarks

A PreviewInfoTable has the following format.

**Name:** peekForm

**Description:** The form reference that will be displayed as preview. If an invalid form reference is given, the preview will not be shown.

**Type:** form reference

**Name:** focusRect (Optional)

**Description:** An array representing a rectangle in widgets view coordinates. If provided, this rectangle will be focused while its surrounding area will be blurred, indicating a preview is available for the widget. If not provided, entire view area of the widget will be focused. If either the width or height is zero, the widget's view width/height is used. The values are supported in percentage(with regard to widget bounds), dp, or pixels. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If an array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:** Array \[x, y, width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “0dp”, “200dp”, “300dp”\], \[“10%”, “10%”, “75%”, “50%”\], \[“10px”, “10px”, “200px”, “480px”\]

**Name:** contentSize (Optional)

**Description:** An array representing the preferred content size of the preview. This allows the user to adjust the preferred width/height dimensions of the preview. If not provided, the preview is shown with default values. If either the width or height is zero, the default preview width/height is used. It is recommended that one of the width/height values be zero for proper adjustment of the other value. For example, if width = 0, the height is adjustable and vice versa. Providing positive values simultaneously for both width and height will result in distorted appearance of preview. The values are supported in dp, pixels, and percentage(with regard to screen bounds). The actual width/height of the preview may vary slightly due to resizing per aspect ratio. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:** Array \[width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “100dp”\], \[“100%”, “0%”\], \[“0px”, “240px”\]

### Example of a PreviewInfoTable:

```

var previewInfoTable = {
    "peekForm": frmSecond,
    "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
    "contentSize": [320, 480]

This method enables you to set the badge value to the given widget at the upper, right corner of the widget.

### Syntax
```

setBadge(badgeText)
```

### Parameters

badgeText \[String\] - Mandatory

Specifies the Text value that appears within the badge. If the length of the badgeText is greater than 1, the badge is a rounded rectangle. For example, if you specify the text of the badge as 88, the number appears in a rounded rectangular badge. If the length of the badge text is 1, the badge is always a circle. The badge can occupy up to 70% of the width of the parent widget. For example, on a button with a width of 100 pixels, a badge with about 100 characters will occupy only 70 pixels of the button width. The badge text is truncated and shows about 30 characters followed by three dots.

skin \[String\] - Optional

The parameter specifies the background color for the badge. The default color is red.

### Return Values

None

### Exceptions

Error

### Remarks

The color for the badge can be defined using a skin. The default color for the badge is red with white lettering.

If you pass an empty string as a parameter, the badge applied to the widget is cleared.

A Badge can be applied only to the FlexContainer Widget. To apply badge to other widgets, place the corresponding widget inside the FlexContainer, then apply Badge to the FlexContainer Widget. Also make sure that the clipBounds property of the FlexContainer are set to false.

If the badge value is a single character (a character or a number), the badge shape is a circle.

![](Resources/Images/widgetbadge.png)

If the badge value contains multiple characters, the badge shape is a rectangle with rounded corners and borders.

The badge can occupy a maximum of 70% width of the parent widget (widget on which badge is applied). For example, on a button with a width of 100 pixels, a badge with about 100 characters will occupy only 70 pixels of the button width. The badge value is truncated and about 30 characters followed by three dots.

When a badge is set, the widgets are re-arranged to accommodate the badge.

For iOS platform, this method is applicable on Box, Label, and Image widgets only.

For Android platform, this method is applicable on Button and Image widgets only.

### Example

```

//This is a generic method that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the setBadge Method for button widget.
//You need to make a corresponding call of the setBadge method for other applicable widgets.
function setBadge() {
    /*To set a badge value with skin "badgeSkin" on a button btn1
placed on a form frm1, use the following code: */
    frm1.btn1.setBadge("2", "badgeSkin");
}
//For instance, the corresponding setEnabled method call on the Label widget is as follows:

<details close markdown="block"><summary>setBounds Method</summary>

* * *

This API helps to fit the map to the provided center, zoom, viewingAngle, and orientation values at one go.

bounds is the dictionary config returned by [getBounds](#getBound).

### Signature
```

setBounds(config)
```

### Parameters

config \[JSDictionary\]: config is a mandatory argument that is a JSDictionary with the following properties:

*   center\[JSObject\] -Mandatory. Specifies the latitude and longitude key.
*   zoom \[JSNumber\] - Mandatory. The zoom level of the camera determines the scale of the map. For Android, float values are accepted. The desired zoom level is in the range of 2.0 to 21.0. Values below this range are set to 2.0 and values above it are set to 21.0. Increase the value to zoom in. Not all areas have tiles at the largest zoom levels. For Windows also, float values are accepted. The desired zoom level is in the range of 1.0 to 20.0.
*   viewingAngle \[JSNumber\] - Mandatory. The viewing angle of the camera, measured in degrees from the current viewer's view point and the intial view point directly facing the Earth. For Android, viewingAngle defines the camera's position on an arc between directly over the map's center position and the surface of the Earth, measured in degrees from the nadir (the direction pointing directly below the camera). The possible value range for this property is restricted depending on the zoom level of the camera. For Windows, viewingAngle is not considered, thus only the default 2-D view is taken into account. So, viewingAngle = 0 is set by default. For iOS and Android,
    
    *   For zoom levels less than 10, the maximum viewingAngle value is 30.
        
    *   For zoom levels from 10 to 14, the maximum viewingAngle value increases linearly from 30 to 45 (for example, at zoom level 12, the maximum is 37.5).
        
    *   For zoom levels from 14 to 15.5, the maximum viewingAngle value increases linearly from 45 to 67.5.
        
    *   For zoom levels greater than 15.5, the maximum viewingAngle value is 67.5.
        
    *   The minimum is always 0 (directly down). If you specify a value outside this range and try to move the camera to this camera position it will be restricted to within these bounds.
        
*   orientation\[JSNumber\] - Mandatory. Specifies the direction at which the camera is pointing, in degrees clockwise from north. For iOS, this is available from iOS 7 onwards. For Windows, the direction at which the camera is pointing, in degrees clockwise from north, where 0 or 360 means North and 90 means East.
*   northeast \[JSObject\] - Specifies the latitude and longitude keys and associated values. For Windows, it is an optional value and it is not respected.
    
*   southwest \[JSObject\] - Specifies the latitude and longitude keys and associated values. For Windows, it is an optional value and it is not respected.
*   latspan \[number\] - Specifies the spanning latitude in degrees. For Windows, it is an optional value and it is not respected.
*   lonspan \[number\] - Specifies the spanning longitude in degrees. For Windows, it is an optional value and it is not respected.

### Return Values

None

### Remarks

1.  You should call the fitToBounds and setBounds methods for onMapLoaded callback.
2.  Before using the setBounds method, you must use the getBounds method to retrieve the current map bounds.
3.  If you call both fitToBounds and setBounds (fitToBounds, setBounds) before navigating to the form that contains the map, the fitToBounds method takes precedence.

### Example

```

/*Sample code to invoke setBounds method for myMap Map widget in frmMap form.*/
var bounds = frmMap.myMap.getBounds();
bounds.center = {
 lat: "17.3850",
 lon: "78.4867",

A callback function that is invoked when the user slightly presses (soft press) the widget.

Callback Syntax

onPeekCallback(widget)

Callback Parameters

_widget_

A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

### Callback Return Values

PreviewInfoTable. See the Remarks section for a description of this table.

### Callback Example

```

function onPeekCallback(widget, contextInfo) {
    var previewInfoTable = {
        "peekForm": frmSecond,
        "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
        "contentSize": [320, 480]
    };
    return previewInfoTable;
}
```

### Return Values

None.

### Remarks

A PreviewInfoTable has the following format.

**Name:** peekForm

**Description:** The form reference that will be displayed as preview. If an invalid form reference is given, the preview will not be shown.

**Type:** form reference

**Name:** focusRect (Optional)

**Description:** An array representing a rectangle in widgets view coordinates. If provided, this rectangle will be focused while its surrounding area will be blurred, indicating a preview is available for the widget. If not provided, entire view area of the widget will be focused. If either the width or height is zero, the widget's view width/height is used. The values are supported in percentage(with regard to widget bounds), dp, or pixels. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If an array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:**Array \[x, y, width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “0dp”, “200dp”, “300dp”\], \[“10%”, “10%”, “75%”, “50%”\], \[“10px”, “10px”, “200px”, “480px”\]

**Name:**contentSize (Optional)

**Description:**An array representing the preferred content size of the preview. This allows the user to adjust the preferred width/height dimensions of the preview. If not provided, the preview is shown with default values. If either the width or height is zero, the default preview width/height is used. It is recommended that one of the width/height values be zero for proper adjustment of the other value. For example, if width = 0, the height is adjustable and vice versa. Providing positive values simultaneously for both width and height will result in distorted appearance of preview. The values are supported in dp, pixels, and percentage(with regard to screen bounds). The actual width/height of the preview may vary slightly due to resizing per aspect ratio. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:**Array \[width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “100dp”\], \[“100%”, “0%”\], \[“0px”, “240px”\]

### Example of a PreviewInfoTable:

```

var previewInfoTable = {
    "peekForm": frmSecond,
    "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
    "contentSize": [320, 480]
};
```

### Example

```

function settingPeek() {
    Form1.setOnPeek(onMyPeekcallback);
}

function onMyPeekcallback(widgetref, contextInfo) {
    if (typeof(contextInfo) === undefined) {
        return null;
    }

    var previewInfoTable = {
        "peekForm": frmSecond,
        "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
        "contentSize": [320, 480]
    };
    return previewInfoTable;

}
```

### Platform Availability

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>setOnPop Method</summary>

* * *

This method overrides the existing onPopCallback for the widget.

### Syntax
```

setOnPop(onPopCallback)
```

### Parameters

onPopCallback

A callback function that is invoked when the user slightly presses (soft press) the widget.

Callback Syntax

onPopCallback(widget,peekForm)

Callback Parameters

_widget_

 A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

_peekForm_

 A form reference that is displayed as preview/peek.

### Callback Return Values

 A form reference.

### Callback Remarks

 Use this callback to set the content for pop. The form handle returned by this callback is used for pop content. In general, the form that is used for preview is used for pop content also. If the pop callback is not implemented, peek disappears and the app returns to its previous state.

### Callback Example

```

function onPopCallback(widget, peekForm) {
    // preview form used for pop also
    return peekForm;
}
```

### Return Values

None.

### Example

```

function settingPop() {
    Form1.setOnPop(myonPopcallback);
}

function myonPopcallback(widgetref, peekForm) {
    // preview form used for pop also
    return peekForm;
}
```

### Exceptions

Error

### Remarks

This method is not applicable on Form, Popup, and Alert. It is also not applicable if the widget is placed in a [Segment](Segment.md). When the widget is placed in a Segment, the default _Visibility_ is set to _true_. If you want to change the value to _false_, you can do so by using [Segment](Segment_Methods.md#segmentedui-methods) methods.

Passing an invalid type other than the above events lead to run time exceptions/ crashes.

This method is not supported on the widgets FlexForm, FlexContainer, and FlexScrollContainer.

### Example

```

//This is a generic method that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to invoke the setVisibility Method for a button widget with animation.

<details close markdown="block"><summary>updatePin Method</summary>

* * *

Updates a single pin on the map.

### Syntax
```

updatePin(pinData)
```

### Parameters

pinData

`pinData` consists of the following key-value pairs.

*   **id**\[String\] \[Mandatory\]: Specifies the unique identifier that represents the pin. If a pin already exists with the same identifier, then the id will be replaced by a new id.
*   **lat** \[String\] \[Mandatory\]: Specifies the latitude of the location.
*   **lon** \[String\] \[Mandatory\]: Specifies the longitude of the location.
*   **name** \[String\] \[Mandatory\]: Specifies a short description for the location.
*   **desc** \[String\] \[Mandatory\]: Specifies a long description for the location.
*   **image** \[String or Image Object\] \[Mandatory\]: Specifies the map pin image that overrides the [defaultPinImage](Map_Properties.md#defaultP).Refer the **Remarks** section for more information.  
    
*   **navigateAndZoom** \[Boolean\] \[Optional\]: Decides whether the navigation to first pin should take place. It is available on Android, Windows, and iOS. The default value of this parameter is true.  
    Here is an example of how to enable this property.
```

     locationData: [{
      lat: "17.445775",
      lon: "78.3731",
      name: "Campus 1",
      desc: "My Office Campus",
      navigateAndZoom: true
    }]
    };
```
*   **showcallout** \[Boolean\] \[Optional\]: Shows the callout pop-up. The default value is _true_.
*   **calloutData** \[JSObject\] \[Optional\]: Specifies the widget data for a given template for a particular location. The value should be a in the form of key-value pairs. The data can have one of the standard keys called `template` that accepts a reference, to provide location-specific template. This template will override the template provided in the [calloutTemplate](Map_Properties.md#calloutT).
    
    > **_Note:_** The widget-data map for a template must be provided in the "[widgetDataMapForCallout](#widgetDa)" property.
    
*   **meta** \[JSObject\] \[Optional\]: Specifies the platform-specific metadata.
    
    *   **color**\[String\] \[Optional\]: Specifies the color for the pop-up. (Supported on Mobile Web and SPA.)
    
    *   **label** \[String\] \[Optional\]: Specifies the text for the pop-up. (Supported on Mobile Web and SPA.)
*   **zIndex**\[Number\] \[Optional\]: Applicable for Android platform only.  
    Specifies the stack order of pins in the Map widget. You can set a Double or Integer value (including negative value) as `zIndex`. When a pin is added to the Map widget with a higher `zIndex`, it will be placed in front of other pins with lower zIndices. If multiple pins are placed at the same co-ordinates, then the [onPinClick](Map_Events.md#onPinCli) event is first triggered for the pin with a higher `zIndex`. The `onPinClick` event is then triggered for the rest of the pins in a descending order of `zIndex` on consecutive clicks. The default value of this parameter is zero.
    
    > **_Note:_** In Android platform, in a map the z-index value stack of the pins are different from the z-index stack of the shapes. The pins are drawn on top of the shapes based on their z-index values. Also, when the pins and shapes (such as circle and polyline) are placed on the map on top of each other, the click event of the pins have a higher priority than the click events of the shapes.
    

### Return Values

None
