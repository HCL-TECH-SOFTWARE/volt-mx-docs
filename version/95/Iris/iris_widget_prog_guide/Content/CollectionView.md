CollectionView Widget
=====================

A CollectionView consists of multiple items, and each item can have multiple child widgets. The CollectionView widget is similar to the [SegmentedUI](Segment.md#segmentedui-widget) widget, and shares many of that widgets properties and methods. The items that fill the CollectionView widget are based on templates.

CollectionView widget can be created only through code.

Following are the real-time use cases of CollectionView widget:

*   **Group Data:** Group data into rows and columns using CollectionView widgets.
*   **Data Handling:** Displays data from various services in your application by using CollectionView widgets. For example, if you have a service that contains the data of various luxury cars, its images, and prices, you can display it in your application using CollectionView widget.
*   **Define Templates**: Create templates to define reusable structure for CollectionView widgets. Templates help you to attain a consistent look-and-feel for the rows and sections of a CollectionView widget.

Widgets are normally added to your application using Volt MX Iris, but can also be added from code. For general information on using widgets in Volt MX Iris, see [Designing an Application](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Part_II_CreatingAnApplication.md) in the [Iris User Guide](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Introduction.md).

For a more hands-on approach on how you can implement CollectionView widget, import and preview the **File Gallery** sample app by using Volt MX Iris.

CollectionView Widget Basics
----------------------------

A CollectionView item can contain any of the following widgets:

*   [Button](Button.md)
*   [Calendar](Calendar.md)
*   [Canvas](canvas.md#canvas-widget)
*   [Image](Image.md)
*   [Label](label.md)
*   [RichText](RichText.md)
*   [Phone](Phone.md)
*   [Slider](Slider.md)
*   [Switch](Switch.md)
*   [TextArea](TextArea.md)
*   [TextBox](TextBox.md)

The data returned when _selectedItem_ is called on the CollectionView widget when the item has the following widgets:

| Widget Name | Properties |||| Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CheckBoxGroup | selectedKeys, selectedKeyValues |||| An array of key value pairs with the keys as mentioned. |
| RadioButtonGroup | selectedKey, selectedKeyValue ||||   |
| ComboBox | selectedKey, selectedKeyValue ||||   |
| TextBox | text ||||   |
| TextArea | text ||||   |
| Calendar | dataComponents |||| An array of the date components |

Each of the above widgets is allowed to have its own skin and control. This gives the flexibility to design a collection view with separate interconnected widgets and expose their properties for mapping.

When a CollectionView [template](#collectionview-templates) is created based on the input data, the template is repeated in the Collection.

### Creating a CollectionView Using a Constructor: voltmx.ui.collectionview

```

var collection = new voltmx.ui.collectionview (basicConf, layoutConf, pspConf);
```

*   **basicConf** is an object with basic properties.
*   **layoutConf** is an object with layout properties.
*   **pspConf** is an object with platform specific properties.

> **_Note:_** The configuration properties should be passed only in the respective configuration objects otherwise they are ignored

Example

```
//Defining properties for an item
var basicConf = {
    id: "ItemId",
    isVisible: true,
    widgetSkin: "widSkin",
    itemSkin: "itemSkn",
    itemFocusSkin: "itemFSkn",
    sectionHeaderSkin: "secHSkin",
    widgetDataMap: {
        widgetId1: "dataid1",
        widgetId2: "dataId2",
        widgetId3: "dataId3",
        widgetId4: "secDataId1",
        widgetId5: "secDataId2"
    },
    itemTemplate: box1
};

var layoutConf = {
    padding: [5, 5, 5, 5],
    margin: [5, 5, 5, 5],
    containerWeight: 100
};

var pspConf = {
    defaultSelection: true
};

//Creating the CollectionView
var collection = new voltmx.ui.collectionview(basicConf,
    layoutConf, pspConf);

//Reading the alternateRowSkin of the CollectionView	
alert("CollectionView alternateRowSkin ::" + collection.alternateRowSkin);
```

### Important Considerations

The following are the important considerations for the CollectionView widget:

animate() api invocation on widgets inside the items of Collection view will not work.

*   items occupy memory from two perspectives:  
      
    *   The amount of data required is based on the number of items visible. For example, if you set data for 100 sitems, memory will only be allocated for the rows which fit the height of the collection view. If each record is 20dp in height and collection view height is 200dp, then memory for only 10 records will be consumed even when data property has records for 100 items.
    *   View hierarchy (Flex Container and other supported widgets) in each item. If the View hierarchy is complex, the memory usage is high.
*   Images in the Collection View are not scaled and are rendered when autosize property set to false. If the image requires lesser space than the allocated space, the image is center aligned.
*   If you want to hide any elements, do not provide any data for that element
*   When a CollectionView is not set as **screenLevelWidget**, load time of CollectionView increases because all the items are loaded at the beginning, but scrolling speed improves.

> **_Note:_** In general Android SDK does not support the bounce-back feature (rubber band effect). But there are some OEM's which extended the Android SDK to support bounce-back like samsung devices. So to summarize this is a device specific feature rather than an Android SDK feature.

### Item Animation

This section provides a brief introduction to the new item animation features in the following topics.

*   Available Animations
*   item Animations and Flex Layout Properties
*   item Animation Events

#### Available Animations

In items, you can move (translate), rotate, or scale child widgets. For example, you can display a rotating logo or a hand icon that simulates waving by moving back and forth.

Also, your app can slide interface controls into a item from off screen. Or it can simulate the hands of an analog clock moving onscreen.

##### item Animations and Flex Layout Properties

With the item animation capabilities, users can programmatically update the Flex layout properties of widgets in the CollectionViews item. Specifically, event handlers and widget methods can change the following properties.

*   top
*   left
*   right
*   bottom
*   width
*   height
*   centerX
*   centerY
*   zIndex

The values above are set relative to the location of the item that contains them, not the CollectionView widget. For example, setting the top property to zero means that the top of the child widget is aligned with the top of the item that contains it. This means that whenever your code updates the child widget’s x position or scale, it is relative to the item’s width. Likewise, whenever your app changes the y position or scale of a widget within a item, it does so relative to the item’s height.

Even though you set the Flex layout properties of child widgets relative to their containing item, you can still specify a position for the child widget that is outside the bounds of the clipping rectangle of the item or page. So you can have some widgets outside the visible area of the item and slide them into the viewable rectangle when a particular event occurs, such as a button click.

In addition, you can also set the width and height values of child widgets in such a way as to place them outside the viewable area. As with the Flex layout position properties, you can alter the width and height values in the event handlers for events such as button clicks.

#### Item Animation Events

The CollectionView widget now provides events that are specific to item animations. For example, suppose that your app enables a swipe gesture in the items of a CollectionView widget. Imagine that the user of your app has just swiped across a item and your app has made visible changes to the item. If the user then swipes or touches in a different item, whatever was happening in the first item should probably be canceled. The item the user swiped should return to its original position and condition.

In this example, the item that the user first swiped receives an event telling it that the user has touched or swiped something else. Therefore, it knows that the action in progress should not be completed and it restores the item to its original state.

Essentially, with the CollectionView item events, a item being updated can react when properly when the user scrolls the widget or touches something in another item.

The CollectionView widget also supports animation in its doLayout event. Specifically, the doLayout event now received the context information it needs to perform animation updates.

#### Item Animation API Elements

To support CollectionView item animations, the Volt MX Iris API includes the following elements.

*   voltmx.ui.createAnimation Function
*   voltmx.ui.makeAffineTransform Function

### CollectionView Templates

The CollectionView widget enables you to create templates to increase the re-usability of your efforts.

#### What is a Template for CollectionView

CollectionView template enables you to define a template for section headers. Only one template can be used for each item. This is primarily useful for developers to achieve common look and feel of section headers along with few widgets added as part of the section header of an item.

On the iOS platform, in the horizontal or vertical view, when a FlexContainer is used as a template for CollectionView, these properties are not available:

| Positional Properties | Dimensional Properties |
| --- | --- |
| left | minWidth |
| right | maxWidth |
| top | minHeight |
| bottom | maxHeight |
| centerX |   |
| centerY |   |

#### Where to use a CollectionView (section) Template

CollectionView sections are used to differentiate or group a set of items.

The section templates are used:

*   To have uniform look and feel of the section headers.
*   To achieve the behavior of having widgets such as an Image and a label for all the section headers of the item.
*   To perform an action on the event of an onclick of an item or a widget in the section header.

#### Creating a Template for CollectionView

When you want the same information to be displayed across all the Section Headers of a Segment in the application, you have a provision to add a Segment Template using Volt MX Iris. For more information about section headers refer to the _VoltMX Iris User Guide_.
