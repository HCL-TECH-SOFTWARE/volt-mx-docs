============

A widget skin defines the look and feel of a widget when it is rendered on a form in an application. Volt MX Iris allows you to create skins and specify the default skins for widgets, and you can also set skins from your JavaScript code following the instructions in the [Dynamic Skinning](Dynamic_Skinning.md) section.

You can not create new skins from code. You have to use skins that have been predefined in Iris.

When you add a widget to a form, the widget uses the default skin unless you specify a skin for the widget in the widget skin properties. You can create as many custom skins within Volt MX Iris as you need.

For more detail, see [Understanding Widget Skins](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Customizing_the_Look_and_Feel_with_Skins.md) in the _VoltMX Iris User Guide_.

The following sections describe the programmatic support for skins:
