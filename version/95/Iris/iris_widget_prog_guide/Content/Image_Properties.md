================

The properties for Image widget are:

* * *


<details close markdown="block"><summary>accessibilityConfig Property</summary>

* * *

Enables you to control accessibility behavior and alternative text for the widget.

For more information on using accessibility features in your app, see the [Accessibility](../../../Iris/app_design_dev/Content/Accessibility_Overview.md) appendix in the Volt MX IrisUser Guide.

### Syntax 

```

accessibilityConfig
```

### Type

Object

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   The accessibilityConfig property is enabled for all the widgets which are supported under the Flex Layout.

> **_Note:_** From Volt MX Iris V9 SP2 GA version, you can provide i18n keys as values to all the attributes used inside the `accessibilityConfig` property. Values provided in the i18n keys take precedence over values provided in `a11yLabel`, `a11yValue`, and `a11yHint` fields.

The accessibilityConfig property is a JavaScript object which can contain the following key-value pairs.

  
| Key | Type | Description | ARIA Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a11yIndex | Integer with no floating or decimal number. | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the order in which the widgets are focused on a screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-index`, `index`, or `taborder` properties. |
| a11yLabel | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies alternate text to identify the widget. Generally the label should be the text that is displayed on the screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-labelledby` property of ARIA in HTML. > **_Note:_** For the Image widget, this parameter maps to the **alt** attribute of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yValue | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | This parameter is similar to the a11yLabel parameter. If the a11yValue is defined, the value of a11yValue is appended to the value of a11yLabel. These values are separated by a space. |
| a11yHint | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-describedby` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yHidden | Boolean | This is an optional parameter. Specifies if the widget should be ignored by assistive technology. The default option is set to _false_. This option is supported on iOS 5.0 and above, Android 4.1 and above, and SPA | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-hidden` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yARIA | Object | This is an optional parameter. For each widget, the key and value provided in this object are added as the attribute and value of the HTML tags respectively. Any values provided for attributes such as `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` using this attribute, takes precedence over values given in `a11yLabel` and `a11yHint` fields. When a widget is provided with the following key value pair or attribute using the a11yARIA object, the tabIndex of the widget is automatically appended as zero.`{"role": "main"}``aria-label` | This parameter is only available on the Desktop Web platform. |

### Android limitations

*   If the results of the concatenation of a11y fields result in an empty string, then `accessibilityConfig` is ignored and the text that is on widget is read out.
*   The soft keypad does not gain accessibility focus during the right/left swipe gesture when the keypad appears.

### SPA/Desktop Web limitations

*   When `accessibilityConfig` property is configured for any widget, the `tabIndex` attribute is added automatically to the `accessibilityConfig` property.
*   The behavior of accessibility depends on the Web browser, Web browser version, Voice Over Assistant, and Voice Over Assistant version.
*   Currently SPA/Desktop web applications support only a few ARIA tags. To achieve more accessibility features, use the attribute a11yARIA. The corresponding tags will be added to the DOM as per these configurations.

### Example 1

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have an accessibilityConfig property.

```

//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the accessibilityConfig Property for button widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the accessibilityConfig property for other applicable widgets.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "Label",
    "a11yValue": "Value",
    "a11yHint": "Hint"    
};
```

### Example 2

This example uses the button widget to implement internationalization in `accessibilityConfig` property, but the principle remains the same for all widgets.

```

/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Native platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString("key1")     
};  
/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Desktop Web platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString(\"key3\")"
};
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>anchorPoint Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the anchor point of the widget bounds rectangle using the widget's coordinate space.

### Syntax 

```

anchorPoint
```

### Type

JSObject

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The value for this property is a JavaScript dictionary object with the keys "x" and "y". The values for the "x" and "y" keys are floating-point numbers ranging from 0 to 1. All geometric manipulations to the widget occur about the specified point. For example, applying a rotation transform to a widget with the default anchor point causes the widget to rotate around its center.

The default value for this property is center ( {"x":0.5, "y":0.5} ), that represents the center of the widgets bounds rectangle. The behavior is undefined if the values are outside the range zero (0) to one (1).

### Example

```

Form1.widget1.anchorPoint = {
    "x": 0.5,
    "y": 0.5
};
```

### Platform Availability

*   iOS, Android, Windows, and SPA

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>base64 Property</summary>

* * *

Returns the base64 encoded string of the image raw bytes. If the image source is a URL, and if the image is not downloaded, or if it encounters an error while downloading, _null_ is returned.

### Syntax 

```

base64
```

### Type

JSObject

### Read/Write

Yes - (Read and Write)

### Remarks

You can read rawBytes/base64 from image only when rawBytes/base64 assigned to an Image Widget. It is not possible to read rawBytes/base64 if you assign source from local resource or pass any URL to Image Widget.  
Image Widget allows you to read only given input type. For example, if base64 is set, only base64 can be read, but not other types, such as rawBytes.

> **_Note:_** SPA platform does not support reading base64 from an image src. But it can read base64 from an image which is displayed through base64.

> **_Note:_** This is a **non-Constructor** property. You cannot set this property through widget constructor. But you can read and write data to it.

### Example

```

//Using base64 property in a form frmBase64.
function readb() {
    var br = frmBase64.image.base64;
    frmBase64.labelbase.text = "base " + br;

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>blur Property</summary>

* * *

You can enable or disable a blur-effect for a widget(for example, a FlexContainer) by making use of a constructor-level property, called **blur**. The **blur** property accepts a dictionary that contains the following keys: enabled, value and style. You must specify an appropriate value for the dictionary keys, otherwise the property will not be valid.

### Syntax 

```

blur
```

### Input Parameters

*   _enabled_: Accepts a Boolean value that basically decides whether to enable or disable the blur-effect for the widget. This is a mandatory attribute.
*   _value_: Level of the blur-effect that needs to be set for the widget. It should ideally be between 0 to 100. If the level is set as 0 no blur is set, even when the enabled property is set as true. This is a mandatory attribute. Even when the _enabled_ attribute is set as false, you need to specify a numerical value to this attribute.
    
*   _style_: Specifies the style in which the blur property can be applied to a widget. This is an optional parameter specific to iOS. The default value of this parameter is constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_LIGHT. You can specify any of the following values to this parameter:  
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_NONE
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_EXTRALIGHT
        
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_LIGHT (default)
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_DARK
        
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_REGULAR
        
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_PROMINENT
        

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   If you set _enabled_ as true, the blur-effect for the widget is enabled.
*   If you set _enabled_ as false, the blur-effect for the widget is disabled.
*   If you specify _value_ as less than 0, the value is taken as 0.
    
*   If you specify _value_ as greater than 100, the value is taken as 100.

### Limitations

*   For Android:
    *   If a FlexContainer or a FlexScrollContainer contains a Map widget, the blur-effect is not applied to the map.
        
    *   If a FlexContainer or a FlexScrollContainer contains a Browser or Video widget, the blur-effect is applied but does not get updated. For example, when the video starts playing, the new rendered frame does not get displayed with the blur-effect.
        
    *   Even if you apply 100% blur for widgets that display any text( such as Label or Calendar widgets), the text on these widgets is not blurred. This is a Native Android limitation. To generate the blur effect for the text, apply a skin with darker background to the Label or Calendar widget. This is true even when the widgets are placed in a FlexContainer with blur effect and the widgets do not have a skin.
    *   Blur effect will not work on widgets added inside BOX containers.

### Example 1

To dynamically set the blur-effect for any widget, such as a FlexContainer, use the following code.

```

//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the blur property for FlexContainer widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the 
blur property for other applicable widgets.*/

Form1.myFlexContainer.blur = {
    "enabled": true,
    "value": 60
};

```

### Example 2

To dynamically set the blur-effect for any widget, such as a FlexContainer in iOS, use the following code.

```

Form1.widget1.blur = {
    "enabled": true,
    "value": 60,
    "style": constants.BLUR_EFFECT_DARK
};
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>imageScaleMode Property</summary>

* * *

This property specifies how the rendered image's width and height are identified when those of the source image varies from the Image widget itself. Image Widget represents the underlying native widget which renders (and applies alignment to) the Source Image.

### Syntax 

```

imageScaleMode
```

### Type

Number

### Read / Write

Yes - (Read and Write)

### Remarks

Default: IMAGE\_SCALE\_MODE\_MAINTAIN\_ASPECT\_RATIO

> **_Note:_** When this property is modified from the code, the scale mode changes will be reflected when a new source image is rendered.

Aspect Ratio defined:

The image aspect ratio is the width (x) of the image compared to its height (y). A square image has a ratio of 1:1, but a non-square (rectangular) image does not have the same height and width. It is commonly expressed as two numbers separated by a colon, as in 16:9.

How the size of the image rendered on the screen is identified?

![](Resources/Images/imagescalemode.png)

Before rendering the Image first the width and height of the Image widget is calculated. The width and height are driven by the container weight that has been specified or referenceWidth and referenceHeight whichever are applicable. Now the Source Image is scaled or cropped as per the ImageScale modes set in the property.

> **_Note:_** For dynamic images (loaded from a remote server), specifying a referenceWidth / referenceHeight avoids unnecessary screen re-layouts.

> **_Note:_** The ImageWidget is aligned as per the widget alignment rules.

![](Resources/Images/sourceimageinfo.png)

These are the available options:

**IMAGE\_SCALE\_MODE\_MAINTAIN\_ASPECT\_RATIO**: This mode resizes the source image to fit in the ImageWidget dimensions while it preserves its native aspect ratio.

*   If the source image size is less than the ImageWidget size then source image is rendered as is. The ImageWidget is aligned as per the widget alignment rules.
*   If the source image is size is greater than the ImageWidget size then the source image is resized to the ImageWidget dimensions while maintaining the aspect ratio.

Image Widget size is calculated as follows:

*   Width is based on containerWeight in case of percentage box and in case of non percentage box , the width is derived from referenceWidth or the original source image width.
*   Height is derived from reference height specified, if reference height is specified. If not the actual Image height is taken.
*   referenceWidth and referenceHeight are not mandatory for this scalemode.

![](Resources/Images/imagescalemodemaintainaspect.png)

**IMAGE\_SCALE\_MODE\_CROP**: This scale mode preserves the original size of the Source Image.

*   If the source image size is less than the ImageWidget size then source image is rendered as is.
*   If the source image is size is greater than the ImageWidget size then the source image is cropped or clipped to fit the ImageWidget.

Image Widget size is calculated for this mode as follows:

*   Width is based on containerWeight in case of percentage box and in case of non-percentage box , the width is derived from referenceWidth.
*   Height is derived from referenceHeight, if referenceHeight is specified. If not the actual Image height is taken

> **_Note:_** referenceWidth and referenceHeight are not mandatory for this scalemode. This mode is not supported on Desktop Web, and SPA platforms. They will render the sourceImage as its actual size.

![](Resources/Images/imagescalemodecrop.png)

**IMAGE\_SCALE\_MODE\_FIT\_TO\_DIMENSIONS**: The source image is resized to fill the ImageWidget dimensions. The aspect ratio is not preserved.

*   If the source image size is less than the ImageWidget size then source image is stretched to the ImageWidget dimensions (height and width).
*   If the source image is size is greater than the ImageWidget size then the source image is squeezed to fill the ImageWidget dimensions (height and width).

Image Widget size is calculated for this mode as follows:

*   Width is the minimum of containerWeight and referenceWidth in case of percentage box and in case of non-percentage box , the width is derived from referenceWidth.
*   Height is derived from reference height specified.

> **_Note:_** referenceWidth and referenceHeight are mandatory for this scalemode. Not specifying the referenceWidth / referenceHeight will lead to undefined behaviour.

> **_Note:_** If the reference image is bigger than container weight, Mobile Web and SPA platforms may not be able to adhere to the container weight but will spill over.

### Remarks

*   For a Segment, the **widgetSwipeMove** Property is configured while setting the data of the Segment.

> **_Note:_** It is not recommended to assign the widgetSwipeMove property on a top Flex container of the segment template widget.

### Limitations

*   When a translation animation is applied to the same widget that has **widgetSwipeMove** already configured, the action which has been performed last takes precedence. For example, if you have set a translation animation on a FlexContainer and then set the _widgetSwipeMove_ property, the actions set in _widgetSwipeMove_ take precedence over the translation animation.
*   The state of the swipe transition of the widget is not retained.
*   In a Segment, the _widgetSwipeMove_ Property must be configured for the rows so that they reset to the previous position.

*   If the widgetSwipeMove property is configured on a top level Flex container of a segment template, the onRowClick event will not be triggered. - Applicable on iOS, Android, and SPA.
*   Android limitation: On Android devices, when the user lifts their finger, the transition occurs immediately.

### Example

Following is a code snippet for a mail app. Here we have used a Segment for listing the mail and the _widgetSwipeMove_ Property has been configured for the _SwipeFlex_ FlexContainer.

```

//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.  
//Here, we have shown how to use the widetSwipeMove property for Button widget.

This property specifies the stack order of a widget. A widget with a higher zIndex is always in front of a widget with a lower zIndex.

The zIndex property is used to set the stack, or layer order of a widget. Widgets with higher values will appear “over”, or “on top of” widgets with lower values. Widgets layered over other widgets will override any interaction events tied to widgets beneath. Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets in the Volt MX Iris hierarchy, inside of a flexContainer or form. The zIndex property accepts only positive values.

### Syntax 

```

zIndex
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The default value for this property is 1.

> **_Note:_** Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets inside the FlexContainer. If zIndex is same for group of overlapping widgets then widget order decides the order of overlapping. The last added widget is displayed on top.

From Volt MX Iris V9 SP2 FP7, developers can configure the Z Index value for a Responsive Web app as **Auto** or **Custom**. When the selected Z Index value is **Auto**, the default Z Index value of 1 is applied. When the selected Z Index value is **Custom**, developers can specify a desired numeric value.

Prior to the V9 SP2 FP7 release, the default value for the Z Index was **1**. When developers imported any third-party libraries with the Z index set as **Auto**, content overflow was disabled as the value of Auto is less than 1.

> **_Note:_** The Z Index value Auto is supported only when the Enable JS Library mode is configured as unchecked.

For existing components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Custom** with **1** as the value.

For new components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Auto** or **1** based on the project level settings.

> **_Note:_** If ModalContainer property is set to true in any of the FlexContainer widget, the Z Index value of that container and all of its parent containers should be set to **Custom**.

**voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO** : Constant to configure the Z Index value as **auto** programmatically.

```

//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto  
 var flx = new voltmx.ui.FlexContainer({ 
  "id": "flx"
  "zIndex": voltmx.flex.ZINDEX_AUTO
});

```
```

//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto
flx.zIndex = voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO;

```

### Example

```

//Sample code to set the zIndex property for widgets.  
frmHome.widgetID.zIndex = 300;
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>zoomEnabled Property</summary>

* * *

This is a Boolean property that enables zooming capabilities for an Image widget. If the property is set as true, the Image widget is rendered with zoom functionality and overlay widgets can be added. If this property is set as false, a regular Image widget is rendered and the addition of overlay widgets is not possible.

### Syntax 

```

zoomEnabled
```

### Type

Boolean

### Read/Write

Read and Write

### Limitations

*   An Image with zoomEnabled Property as true does not showcase zoom functionality inside a Segment.
    
*   An Image widget with Preferred height has the height of the image according to its initial values before zoom. The width or height of an Image widget does not increase when the image is scaled.
    
*   Transform properties for Image widget with zoomEnabled set to true do not function.
    

### Example

```
//Sample code to enable zoom in an Image widget.  
  
frmImage.myImage.zoomEnabled = true;

```

### Limitations

*   The frame of the Image widget is not changed for JavaScript space, even if it is zoomed.

<details close markdown="block"><summary>zoomValue Property</summary>

* * *

This is a Float-value property that defines the current zoom state of an Image widget. This value is considered only when the [zoomEnabled](#zoomEnabled) Property is set as true. If the zoomValue Property is not specified, its value is taken as 1 by default.

### Syntax 

```

zoomValue
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read and Write

Default Value

1

### Example

```

//Sample code to set the value of zoom to an Image widget.  
  
frmImage.myImage.zoomValue = 2;

```

### Limitations

*   Minimum zoomValue is 1. This means that you cannot reduce the size of the image below this value.
    
*   If you do not specify zoomValue, then by default it is taken as 1.
    
*   While adding overlay widgets, you must calculate the position of the widgets user based on the zoomValue.
