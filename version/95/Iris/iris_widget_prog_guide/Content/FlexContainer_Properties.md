Remarks

You can define any one of the following values to the property:

*   constants.ACCESSIBILITY\_NAVIGATION\_MODE\_NATIVE: Native accessibility navigation. Applies the platform's default accessibility navigation order. This is the default value for the property.
*   constants.ACCESSIBILITY\_NAVIGATION\_MODE\_PARENT: Applies a custom navigation for widgets based on the a11yIndices set to the child widgets.
*   constants.ACCESSIBILITY\_NAVIGATION\_MODE\_DEFAULT: Derives the property value from its immediate parent going all the way to form level.

Example

```
var flexContainer1 = new voltmx.ui.FlexContainer({
    "id": "flexContainer1",
    "top": "19dp",
    "left": "43dp",
    "width": "304dp",
    "height": "251dp",
    "zIndex": 1,

autogrowMode Property (Deprecated)

* * *

This property is enables you to grow the height of the FlexContainer when child widgets or content is added on the FlexContainer. The options are:

The autogrowMode property is used to set the height of a widget dynamically based on the derived height of the widget’s content, or from the child widget’s contents. The options are:

*   voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_NONE (value is 0)
*   voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT (value is 1)

Syntax

autogrowMode

Type

Number

Read/Write

Read only

Remarks

If you want to configure this property in , configure the height property of FlexContainer as preferred, then generates the autogrowMode property as voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT.

The default value for this property is voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_NONE.

If one or all the child widgets height or other properties such as centerY, top, bottom, minHeight or maxHeight are used in determining the height given in percentage (%), then the autogrowMode property will not work for the FlexContainer and its height fallback to default configuration value.

Rules and priorities of autogrowMode property

*   The autogrowMode property is ignored if the height of the widget is computable either through explicit value or implicit calculation.
    
*   If the autogrowMode property is configured as voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT, then preferredSize (based on content or child widgets ) is computed, and min/max constraints are applied.
*   If the autogrowMode property is configured as voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_NONE, the default value is applied with min/max constraints.
*   The height of a FlexContainer widget will not grow dynamically if the height of any widget changes because of the change in widget's skin state (such as from normal to focus).
*   If a widgets top value is given in negative values, then the widget is clipped in case of Free Form and overlapped on the previous widget in case of Flow Vertical.
*   The autogrowMode property is not supported for a FlexContainer widget that is placed inside an HBox or a VBox.
*   For example, a FlexContainer (flexA) has a FlexContainer (flexB), which is not set to grow dynamically, whose clipBounds is set to false. The children of flexB that are out of the bounds of flexB do not have any effect on the height of flexA. Only the heights of direct children of flexA will decide the height of flexA.
*   In templates, FlexContainer will grow only in SegmentedUI Table View only. In all other views, autogrowMode property is not supported.
*   The autogrowMode property for a FlexContainer is not supported in the Tab Widget.
*   In the Windows platform, the autogrowMode property of a SegmentedUI is not supported inside a FlexContainer.
*   The autogrowMode property of a SegmentedUI with a large number of rows leads to performance and memory issues.
*   Excessive usage of auto grow flex containers inside a form will impact the performance of the application.
*   Rendering of widgets with preferred height or preferred width will take more time in mobile and tablet browsers compared to desktop browsers.
*   When animating the height property of the child widget of a FlexContainer in iOS, Windows, and SPA platforms, after the animation is complete, then parent containers height increases based on the value provided in 100th step when fillMode is configured as voltmx.anim.FILL\_MODE\_FORWARDS.
*   When animating the height property of the child widget of a FlexContainer in the Android platform, the parent container's height grows along with the child widget's height.

When to Use

Case1: If the height of the FlexContainer is dependent on the heights of the child widgets that are added.

Case2: If you are using the FlexContainer in a SegmentedUI template, where each row of the SegmentedUI row height is dependent on the child widgets content. Configure the height property of the FlexContainer as preferred, then generates the autogrowMode property as voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT.

Example

Setting the autogrowMode property on an existing widget

```
//Sample code to set the autogrowMode property of a FlexContainer widget.
//Here, flexcontainer1 FlexContainer retains the height given in the height Property.
frmHome.flexcontainer1.autogrowMode=voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_NONE;

//Here, flexcontainer1 FlexContainer uses the child widget content to determine its height.
frmHome.flexcontainer1.autogrowMode=voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT;
```

Example

Setting the autogrowMode property on widget creation

```
//Flex Container Creation.
var flexcontainer1 = new voltmx.ui.FlexContainer({
    "id": "flexcontainer1",
    "isVisible": true,
    "width": "100%",
    "zIndex": 1,
    "clipBounds": true,
    "skin": "skin3",
    "autogrowMode": voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT,
    "layoutType": voltmx.flex.FREE\_FORM
});

flexcontainer1.setDefaultUnit(voltmx.flex.DP);

Remarks

The default value for this property is true.

In Windows platform, setting the clipBounds property to false on FlexContainer with Free form layout may not work if FlexContainer has border width. It automatically clips.

This property does not have any effect on the following scrollable widgets:

*   FlexScrollContainer
*   Map
*   SegmentedUI
*   Browser

Example

Setting the clipBounds property on an existing widget

```
//Sample code to set the clipBounds property of a FlexContainer widget.
//Here, the clipBounds property is used to clip the child widgets.
frmHome.flexcontainer1.clipBounds = true;

//Here, the clipBounds property shows the child widgets outside the container's bounds.

    *   For x-axis values are width, left, right, centerX in case of % units are relative to parent's width.
    *   For y-axis values are height, top, bottom, centerY in case of % units are relative to parent's height.
*   `voltmx.flex.FLOW_HORIZONTAL`: The calculations for horizontal layout type are:  
    *   left is measured from right edge of the left sibling widget and right is measured from the left edge of the right sibling widget.
    *   horizontal space between two widgets is right of the left sibling widget + left of the right sibling widget.
    *   order of the widgets appearing in the flow is the order in which the widgets are added.
    *   top and bottom properties are measured from the boundaries of the parent.
*   `voltmx.flex.FLOW_VERTICAL`: The calculations for vertical layout type are:  
      
    *   top is measured from bottom edge of the top sibling widget and bottom is measured from the top edge of bottom sibling widget.
    *   vertical space between two widgets is bottom of the top sibling widget + top of the bottom sibling widget.
    *   order of the widgets appearing in the flow is the order in which the widgets are added.
    *   left and right properties are measured from the boundaries of the parent.
*   `voltmx.flex.RESPONSIVE_GRID`: When you assign the value of the layoutType property as `voltmx.flex.RESPONSIVE_GRID`, you can assign different layouts for different breakpoints. Here are the some of the things to consider when you assign the Responsive Grid layout.  
    *   Widgets are aligned from left to right with the span and offset values provided in the Look tab of the Properties panel.
    *   You can only provide FlexContainer widget as the direct child after assigning this value to the parent.
    *   The FlexContainer cell respects height, minHeight, maxHeight property only.
    *   If the width of a child widget exceeds the width of the container widget, the next child widget is wrapped and placed in the next row.

reverseLayoutDirection Property

* * *

The _reverseLayoutDirection_ property specifies the stacking order of the child widgets of FlexContainer. It is not applicable when the value of the [layoutType](#layoutTy) Property is _voltmx.flex.FREE\_FORM_.

The default value of the property is false.

Syntax

reverseLayoutDirection

Type

Boolean

Read / Write

Read + Write

Remarks

1.  If the value of _reverseLayoutDirection_ property is set as false:
    *   When the value of _layoutType_ property is, voltmx.flex.FLOW\_HORIZONTAL, the child widgets are stacked from left to right.
    *   When the value of _layoutType_ property is, voltmx.flex.FLOW\_VERTICAL, the child widgets are stacked from top to bottom.
2.  If the value of _reverseLayoutDirection_ property is set as true:
    *   When the value of _layoutType_ property is, voltmx.flex.FLOW\_HORIZONTAL, the child widgets are stacked from right to left.
    *   When the value of _layoutType_ property is, voltmx.flex.FLOW\_VERTICAL, the child widgets are stacked from bottom to top.

Limitations

*   When the value of _reverseLayoutDirection_ property is true, the frame values of the child widgets are calculated with respect to the [left](FlexScrollContainer_Properties.md#left) property of FlexContainer. The frame values given for different features of FlexContainer widget, such as animation, must reflect this change.

Example

You can change the flow layout direction of a FlexContainer with ID as "flexContainer1" in form "myForm" during run time by entering the following code.

Example 1:

```
var flexContainer1 = new voltmx.ui.FlexContainer({
    "id": " flexcontainer1",
    "top": "60%",
    "left": "0dp",
    "width": "100%",
    "autogrowMode": voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT,
    "zIndex": 1,
    "isVisible": true,
    "clipBounds": true,
    "Location": "\[0,0\]",
    "skin": "flexSkin3",
    " reverseLayoutDirection": true,

right Property

* * *

* * *

rippleBackground Property

* * *

Defines the ripple background for a FlexContainer Widget.

Syntax

rippleBackground

Type

JSObject

Parameters

rippleColor

Optional. Defines the color for the ripples.

You can define the ripple color in the RGBA format, where the R, G, and B range from 00 to ff, and the A (transparency) ranges from 00 (zero percent) to 64 (100 percent). Or, you can define the rippleColor as a key-value pair for each view state. The keys allowed are normal and pressed.

contentLayers

Optional. Array of two JS Objects. Each JS Object contains following key-value pairs to define a layer for ripple background. You can define the background for the ripple as a skin or as a background color.

background

Defines the background for the ripples. You can define the color in the RGBA format, where the R, G, and B range from 00 to ff, and the A (transparency) ranges from 00 (zero percent) to 64 (100 percent). Or, you can specify a skin as the background.

backgroundType

Defines the type of a background. You can define:

_RIPPLE\_CONTENT\_LAYER\_COLOR_: Background as color in the RGBA format.

_RIPPLE\_CONTENT\_LAYER\_SKIN_: Background as a skin.

Mask

Defines the bounds for the ripple animation. The property takes the Boolean value and by default is set to false.

padding

Defines the space around the ripple background. Specify an array of four integers \[left, top, right, bottom\]

paddingInPixel

Defines whether the units of specified padding values should be in pixels or in percentage. The property takes the Boolean value.

_true_: Indicates the specified padding values should be in pixels.

_false_: Indicates the specified padding values should be in percentage.

paddingMode

Optional. Defines how layer padding should affect the bounds of subsequent layers. You can define:

_RIPPLE\_PADDING\_MODE\_NEST_: Nests each layer inside padding of the previous layer.

_RIPPLE\_PADDING\_MODE\_STACK_: Stacks each layer on top of the previous layer. This is the default value.

Read/Write

Read + Write

Remarks

If you set rippleBackground, skin, and focusSkin properties to the FlexContainer Widget through a constructor, the rippleBackground property takes the priority. Later, if you modify or set the skin properties such as skin, focusSkin, pressedSkin, and disabledSkins dynamically, the skin properties take priority.

Example

Setting the rippleBackground property on an existing widget

```
//Sample code to set the rippleBackground property for a FlexContainer widget. 
myForm.myFlexContainer.rippleBackground = {
 rippleColor: "ffff0000",
 contentLayers: \[{
  background: "ffffff00",
  backgroundType: constants.RIPPLE\_CONTENT\_LAYER\_COLOR,
  mask: false,
  padding: \[10, 10, 10, 10\]
 }, {
  background: btnSkin,
  backgroundType: constants.RIPPLE\_CONTENT\_LAYER\_SKIN,
  mask: true
 }\],
 paddingMode: constants.PADDING\_MODE\_NEST
};
```

Example

Setting the rippleBackground property on widget creation

```
//Flex Container Creation.
var flxCnt1 = new voltmx.ui.FlexContainer({
    "id": "flexcontainer1",

## <a id="shadowColor-Property"></a>shadowColor Property

* * *

Specifies the color for the shadow of the widget.

Syntax

shadowColor

Type

Color constant or Hexadecimal number

Read/Write

Read + Write

Remarks

*   Colors can be specified using a 6 digit or an 8-digit hex value with alpha position. For example, ffff65 or ffffff00.
*   When the 4-byte color format (RGBA) string is used, an alpha (A) value of 65 specifies that the color is transparent. If the value is 00, the color is opaque. The Alpha value is in percentage and must be given in the hexadecimal value for the color (100% in hexadecimal value is 65).  
      
    For example, red complete opaque is FF000000. Red complete transparent is FF000065. The values 0x and # are not allowed in the string.
*   A color constant is a String that is defined at the theme level. Ensure that you append the **$** symbol at the beginning of the color constant.
*   This property does not have a default value.
*   This property has more priority than (and overrides) the shadow property of the configured skin. Even if there is no skin configured for the widget, this property updates the skin.
*   On the Android platform, if the clipBounds property and the rounded corner is enabled for the FlexContainer widget, the shadowColor appears beyond the rounded corner area.

Example

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have the shadowColor property.

```
Form1.btn1.shadowColor = "ea5075";
```

shadowDepth Property

* * *

Defines the depth of the shadow effect applied to the FlexContainer Widget.

Syntax

shadowDepth

Type

Number

Read/Write

Remarks

*   The JSON Object contains the X-coordinate and Y-coordinates for the offset in the following format:
    
    `{x: value in pixels, y: value in pixels}`
    
*   The default unit for the value of this property is pixels.
*   This property does not have a default value.
*   This property has more priority than (and overrides) the shadow property of the configured skin. Even if there is no skin configured for the widget, this property updates the skin.

Example

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have the shadowOffset property.
