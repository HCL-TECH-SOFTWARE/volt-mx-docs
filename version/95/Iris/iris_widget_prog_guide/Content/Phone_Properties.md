<details close markdown="block"><summary>accessibilityConfig Property</summary>

* * *

Enables you to control accessibility behavior and alternative text for the widget.

For more information on using accessibility features in your app, see the [Accessibility](../../../Iris/app_design_dev/Content/Accessibility_Overview.md) appendix in the Volt MX IrisUser Guide.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

accessibilityConfig
```

<b>Type</b>

Object

<b>Read/Write</b>

Read + Write

<b>Remarks</b>

*   The accessibilityConfig property is enabled for all the widgets which are supported under the Flex Layout.

> **_Note:_** From Volt MX Iris V9 SP2 GA version, you can provide i18n keys as values to all the attributes used inside the `accessibilityConfig` property. Values provided in the i18n keys take precedence over values provided in `a11yLabel`, `a11yValue`, and `a11yHint` fields.

The accessibilityConfig property is a JavaScript object which can contain the following key-value pairs.

  
| Key | Type | Description | ARIA Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a11yIndex | Integer with no floating or decimal number. | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the order in which the widgets are focused on a screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-index`, `index`, or `taborder` properties. |
| a11yLabel | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies alternate text to identify the widget. Generally the label should be the text that is displayed on the screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-labelledby` property of ARIA in HTML. > **_Note:_** For the Image widget, this parameter maps to the **alt** attribute of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yValue | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | This parameter is similar to the a11yLabel parameter. If the a11yValue is defined, the value of a11yValue is appended to the value of a11yLabel. These values are separated by a space. |
| a11yHint | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-describedby` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yHidden | Boolean | This is an optional parameter. Specifies if the widget should be ignored by assistive technology. The default option is set to _false_. This option is supported on iOS 5.0 and above, Android 4.1 and above, and SPA | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-hidden` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yARIA | Object | This is an optional parameter. For each widget, the key and value provided in this object are added as the attribute and value of the HTML tags respectively. Any values provided for attributes such as `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` using this attribute, takes precedence over values given in `a11yLabel` and `a11yHint` fields. When a widget is provided with the following key value pair or attribute using the a11yARIA object, the tabIndex of the widget is automatically appended as zero.`{"role": "main"}``aria-label` | This parameter is only available on the Desktop Web platform. |

Android limitations

*   If the results of the concatenation of a11y fields result in an empty string, then `accessibilityConfig` is ignored and the text that is on widget is read out.
*   The soft keypad does not gain accessibility focus during the right/left swipe gesture when the keypad appears.

SPA/Desktop Web limitations

*   When `accessibilityConfig` property is configured for any widget, the `tabIndex` attribute is added automatically to the `accessibilityConfig` property.
*   The behavior of accessibility depends on the Web browser, Web browser version, Voice Over Assistant, and Voice Over Assistant version.
*   Currently SPA/Desktop web applications support only a few ARIA tags. To achieve more accessibility features, use the attribute a11yARIA. The corresponding tags will be added to the DOM as per these configurations.

<b>Example 1</b>

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have an accessibilityConfig property.

```
//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the accessibilityConfig Property for button widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the accessibilityConfig property for other applicable widgets.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "Label",
    "a11yValue": "Value",
    "a11yHint": "Hint"    
};
```

<b>Example 2</b> 

This example uses the button widget to implement internationalization in `accessibilityConfig` property, but the principle remains the same for all widgets.

```
/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Native platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString("key1")     
};  
/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Desktop Web platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString(\"key3\")"
};

```

<b>Type</b>

JSObject

<b>Read/Write</b>

Read + Write

<b>Remarks</b>

The value for this property is a JavaScript dictionary object with the keys "x" and "y". The values for the "x" and "y" keys are floating-point numbers ranging from 0 to 1. All geometric manipulations to the widget occur about the specified point. For example, applying a rotation transform to a widget with the default anchor point causes the widget to rotate around its center.

The default value for this property is center ( {"x":0.5, "y":0.5} ), that represents the center of the widgets bounds rectangle. The behavior is undefined if the values are outside the range zero (0) to one (1).

<details close markdown="block"><summary>zIndex Property</summary>

* * *

This property specifies the stack order of a widget. A widget with a higher zIndex is always in front of a widget with a lower zIndex.

The zIndex property is used to set the stack, or layer order of a widget. Widgets with higher values will appear “over”, or “on top of” widgets with lower values. Widgets layered over other widgets will override any interaction events tied to widgets beneath. Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets in the Volt MX Iris hierarchy, inside of a flexContainer or form. The zIndex property accepts only positive values.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

zIndex
```


<b>Type</b>

Number

<b>Read/Write</b>

Read + Write

<b>Remarks</b>

The default value for this property is 1.

> **_Note:_** Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets inside the FlexContainer. If zIndex is same for group of overlapping widgets then widget order decides the order of overlapping. The last added widget is displayed on top.

From Volt MX Iris V9 SP2 FP7, developers can configure the Z Index value for a Responsive Web app as **Auto** or **Custom**. When the selected Z Index value is **Auto**, the default Z Index value of 1 is applied. When the selected Z Index value is **Custom**, developers can specify a desired numeric value.

Prior to the V9 SP2 FP7 release, the default value for the Z Index was **1**. When developers imported any third-party libraries with the Z index set as **Auto**, content overflow was disabled as the value of Auto is less than 1.

> **_Note:_** The Z Index value Auto is supported only when the Enable JS Library mode is configured as unchecked.

For existing components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Custom** with **1** as the value.

For new components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Auto** or **1** based on the project level settings.

> **_Note:_** If ModalContainer property is set to true in any of the FlexContainer widget, the Z Index value of that container and all of its parent containers should be set to **Custom**.

**voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO** : Constant to configure the Z Index value as **auto** programmatically.

```
//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto  
 var flx = new voltmx.ui.FlexContainer({ 
  "id": "flx"
  "zIndex": voltmx.flex.ZINDEX_AUTO
});

```
```
//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto
flx.zIndex = voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO;

```

<b>Example</b>

```
//Sample code to set the zIndex property for widgets.  
frmHome.widgetID.zIndex = 300;
