FlexForm Events
===============

The FlexForm widget has the following events associated with it:

* * *

<details close markdown="block"><summary>addWidgets Event</summary>

* * *

An event callback invoked by the platform when the form is accessed for first time after its construction. This function gets executed only once on in lifetime of the form. If a destroyed form is accessed, the form is re-initialized and this callback is once again invoked. Forms can be destroyed using destroy method.

### Syntax

```

addWidgets()
```

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Example

```

//Sample code to set a callback to the addWidgets event for a FlexForm.

myForm.addWidgets=addWidgetsCallback;

function addWidgetsCallback() {
    //write your logic to create and add child widgets
}
```

### Platform Availability

*   iOS
*   Android
*   Windows
*   SPA

* * *

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>doLayout Event</summary>

* * *

This event is invoked for every widget when the widget position and dimensions are computed. This event is invoked for all the widgets placed inside flex containers. This event is invoked in the order in which the widgets are added to the widget hierarchy and expect the frame property of the widget is calculated and available for use within this event.

### Syntax

```

doLayout()
```

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

This event is used to set the layout properties of child widgets in the relation to self and peer widgets whose layout is not yet performed.

> **_Note:_** The number of times this event invoked may vary per platform. It is not recommended to write business logic assuming that this function is invoked only once when there is a change in positional or dimensional properties. This event will not trigger when transformations are applied though widget is moved or scaled or rotated from its original location.

### Example

```

//Sample code to set doLayout event callback to a button widget.
/*This code changes the top property of button2 and makes it appear below button1.*/
myForm.button1.doLayout=doLayoutButton1;


function doLayoutButton1(){
      
    myForm.button2.top = myForm.button1.frame.height;
}
```

### Platform Availability

*   iOS

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>init Event</summary>

* * *

This event gets called only once in form life cycle that is when the form is ready with its widget hierarchy. This will get called after [addwidgets](#masterda) method allowing user for any one-time initializations.

When form is destroyed and reused again, _init_ gets called as a part of form lifecycle.

### Syntax

```

init()
```

Parameters

_formHandle_

This parameter specifies handle of the FlexForm on which this event is defined.

_breakpoint_\[Number\]

This parameter specifies the current breakpoint value. When the window size exceeds the highest breakpoint, this parameter returns the constant: **constants.BREAKPOINT\_MAX\_VALUE**.

### Remarks

From Iris V9 release, onBreakpointChange event is triggered while using responsive web components also.

### Example

```

function breakpoint_callback (myFormHandle, breakpoint) {
    voltmx.print("breakpoint changed");
}

<details close markdown="block"><summary>onMapping Event</summary>

* * *

Volt MX Iris creates this event when you drag and drop a service operation on either a FlexForm, FlexContainer, or FlexScrollContainer. You can define actions for this event by using [Action Editor](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/working_with_Action_Editor.md).

### Read/Write

You can neither read nor write the onMapping Event through code.

### Remarks

The actions defined in this event are triggered after the actions specified in the [preShow](#preShow) Event are executed. The actions for the preShow Event are executed first, and then the actions for the onMapping Event are executed.

> **_Note:_** When you define the preShow Event dynamically, the onMapping Event will be overridden.

### Platform Availability

    Available on all platforms

* * *

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>onNavigate Event</summary>

* * *

This event is invoked when you navigate from one form to another. This is a [Form Controller event](../../../Iris/voltmx_ref_arch_api/Content/FormController_Events.md#onNavigate) and is used only in [Reference Architecture](../../../Iris/voltmx_ref_arch_api/Content/VoltMX_Reference_Architecture_Guide.md)\- based projects.

### Syntax

```

onNavigate(context, isBackNavigation)
```

### Parameters

_context \[Object\]_

AÂ JavaScript object that contains the data that the destination form requires after navigation.

_isBackNavigation \[Boolean\]_

This parameter determines whether you have clicked the back button or not. It has the value as _true_ when you click the back button and _false_ when you do not click the back button.

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

To navigate from one form to another, you must create a [Navigation](../../../Iris/voltmx_ref_arch_api/Content/Navigation_Object.md) Object. This object navigates to the destination form's controller. The form's controller in turn displays the view of the form.

> **_Note:_** 1\. If you provide the onNavigate event through the Action Editor and the Form Controller, then the code in the Form Controller overrides the actions for onNavigate event given in the Action Editor.  
2\. While using the **this** keyword (for example, this.view) in onNavigate event (FormController event) to point to the current controller, you must ensure that the function is not a **fat arrow** function. Because in fat arrow function declarations, the **this** pointer is taken from the parent scope and might not point to the current FormController. For more information on this limitation, click [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions).  

### This event is useful in the following scenarios:

*   To provide data that the destination form requires after the navigation.
*   To prepare data that the destination form requires after the navigation.
*   To pause the navigation if any asynchronous calls are in progress.

### Example

```

define({

    onNavigate: function(context, isBackNavigation) {
        this.context = context;
        this.pauseNavigation();
        voltmx.net.invokeServiceAsync(url, this.callback1);
    },

    callback1: function(result) {
        this.resumeNavigation();
    }

});
