======================

Widgets are categorized as Containers, Basic, and Advanced based on the behavior and characteristics of the widgets.

*   **Basic Widgets**: These widgets are used for basic functions on a form. They are the most commonly used widgets in an application design. These widgets are components that act independently of the Container Widgets.
*   **Container Widgets**: These hold container, basic or advanced widgets within them.
*   **Advanced widgets**: Used to achieve advanced interaction within an application. You can use these widgets along with basic widgets to achieve a complex interaction design.
