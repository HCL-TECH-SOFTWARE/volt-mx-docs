<a id="accessibilityconfig"/>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>accessibilityConfig Property</summary>

* * *

Enables you to control accessibility behavior and alternative text for the widget.

For more information on using accessibility features in your app, see the [Accessibility](../../../Iris/app_design_dev/Content/Accessibility_Overview.md) appendix in the VoltMX IrisUser Guide.

### Syntax

```

accessibilityConfig
```

### Type

Object

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   The accessibilityConfig property is enabled for all the widgets which are supported under the Flex Layout.

> **_Note:_** From VoltMX Iris V9 SP2 GA version, you can provide i18n keys as values to all the attributes used inside the `accessibilityConfig` property. Values provided in the i18n keys take precedence over values provided in `a11yLabel`, `a11yValue`, and `a11yHint` fields.

The accessibilityConfig property is a JavaScript object which can contain the following key-value pairs.

  
| Key | Type | Description | ARIA Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a11yIndex | Integer with no floating or decimal number. | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the order in which the widgets are focused on a screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-index`, `index`, or `taborder` properties. |
| a11yLabel | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies alternate text to identify the widget. Generally the label should be the text that is displayed on the screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-labelledby` property of ARIA in HTML. > **_Note:_** For the Image widget, this parameter maps to the **alt** attribute of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yValue | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | This parameter is similar to the a11yLabel parameter. If the a11yValue is defined, the value of a11yValue is appended to the value of a11yLabel. These values are separated by a space. |
| a11yHint | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-describedby` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yHidden | Boolean | This is an optional parameter. Specifies if the widget should be ignored by assistive technology. The default option is set to _false_. This option is supported on iOS 5.0 and above, Android 4.1 and above, and SPA | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-hidden` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yARIA | Object | This is an optional parameter. For each widget, the key and value provided in this object are added as the attribute and value of the HTML tags respectively. Any values provided for attributes such as `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` using this attribute, takes precedence over values given in `a11yLabel` and `a11yHint` fields. When a widget is provided with the following key value pair or attribute using the a11yARIA object, the tabIndex of the widget is automatically appended as zero.`{"role": "main"}``aria-label` | This parameter is only available on the Desktop Web platform. |

Android limitations

*   If the results of the concatenation of a11y fields result in an empty string, then `accessibilityConfig` is ignored and the text that is on widget is read out.
*   The soft keypad does not gain accessibility focus during the right/left swipe gesture when the keypad appears.

SPA/Desktop Web limitations

*   When `accessibilityConfig` property is configured for any widget, the `tabIndex` attribute is added automatically to the `accessibilityConfig` property.
*   The behavior of accessibility depends on the Web browser, Web browser version, Voice Over Assistant, and Voice Over Assistant version.
*   Currently SPA/Desktop web applications support only a few ARIA tags. To achieve more accessibility features, use the attribute a11yARIA. The corresponding tags will be added to the DOM as per these configurations.

### Example 1

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have an accessibilityConfig property.

```
//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the accessibilityConfig Property for button widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the accessibilityConfig property for other applicable widgets.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "Label",
    "a11yValue": "Value",
    "a11yHint": "Hint"    
};
```

### Example 2

This example uses the button widget to implement internationalization in `accessibilityConfig` property, but the principle remains the same for all widgets.

```
/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Native platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString("key1")     
};  
/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Desktop Web platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString(\"key3\")"
};
```

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>activeStateSkin Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the look and feel of a widget when the widget is in focus.

When the activeStateSkin property is configured for a widget, the activeStateSkin is applied to the widget when a user focuses on the widget (either by using the TAB key, mouse-click, or by using the setActive API programmatically).

### Syntax

```
activeStateSkin 
```

### Type

String

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

If a widget has the activeStateSkin, focusSkin, and the hoverSkin properties configured, the skins are applied based on the mouse-action performed on the widget:

*    The **focusSkin** is applied on the mouse-down action on the widget.
*    The **hoverSkin** is applied on the mouse-over action on the widget.
*    The **activeStateSkin** is applied on the mouse-release action on the widget.


### Example

Setting the activeStateSkin property on an existing widget

```
//The Active State Skin is a skin created under the Skins tab
frmButton.myButton.activeStateSkin= 'btnActiveStateSkin';
```

### Platform Availability

*    Available in the IDE

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>anchorPoint Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the anchor point of the widget bounds rectangle using the widget's coordinate space.

### Syntax

```

anchorPoint
```

### Type

JSObject

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The value for this property is a JavaScript dictionary object with the keys "x" and "y". The values for the "x" and "y" keys are floating-point numbers ranging from 0 to 1. All geometric manipulations to the widget occur about the specified point. For example, applying a rotation transform to a widget with the default anchor point causes the widget to rotate around its center.

The default value for this property is center ( {"x":0.5, "y":0.5} ), that represents the center of the widgets bounds rectangle. The behavior is undefined if the values are outside the range zero (0) to one (1).

### Example

```
Form1.widget1.anchorPoint = {
    "x": 0.5,
    "y": 0.5
};
```

### Platform Availability

*   iOS, Android, Windows, and SPA

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>backgroundColor Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the background color of the widget.

### Syntax

```

backgroundColor
```

### Type

Color constant or Hexadecimal number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   The initial value of backgroundColor has to be specified explicitly. If not, Iris will not deduce the values from the existing skin and this will lead to undefined behavior.
*   Colors can be specified using a 6 digit or an 8-digit hex value with alpha position. For example, ffff65 or ffffff00.
*   When the 4-byte color format (RGBA) string is used, an alpha (A) value of 65 specifies that the color is transparent. If the value is 00, the color is opaque. The Alpha value is in percentage and must be given in the hexadecimal value for the color (100% in hexadecimal value is 65).  
    For example, red complete opaque is FF000000. Red complete transparent is FF000065. The values 0x and # are not allowed in the string.
*   A color constant is a String that is defined at the theme level. Ensure that you append the **$** symbol at the beginning of the color constant.
*   This property does not have a default value.
*   This property has more priority than (and overrides) the background property of the configured skin. Even if there is no skin configured for the widget, this property updates the skin.
*   The backgroundColor, backgroundColorTwoStepGradient, backgroundColoMultiStepGradient, and backgroundImage properties are mutually exclusive. The property that was set most recently is given higher priority over other properties.

### Example

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have the backgroundColor property.

```
Form1.btn1.backgroundColor = "ea5075";

```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>blur Property</summary>

* * *

You can enable or disable a blur-effect for a widget(for example, a FlexContainer) by making use of a constructor-level property, called **blur**. The **blur** property accepts a dictionary that contains the following keys: enabled, value and style. You must specify an appropriate value for the dictionary keys, otherwise the property will not be valid.

### Syntax

```

blur
```

### Input Parameters

*   _enabled_: Accepts a Boolean value that basically decides whether to enable or disable the blur-effect for the widget. This is a mandatory attribute.
*   _value_: Level of the blur-effect that needs to be set for the widget. It should ideally be between 0 to 100. If the level is set as 0 no blur is set, even when the enabled property is set as true. This is a mandatory attribute. Even when the _enabled_ attribute is set as false, you need to specify a numerical value to this attribute.
    
*   _style_: Specifies the style in which the blur property can be applied to a widget. This is an optional parameter specific to iOS. The default value of this parameter is constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_LIGHT. You can specify any of the following values to this parameter:  
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_NONE
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_EXTRALIGHT
        
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_LIGHT (default)
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_DARK
        
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_REGULAR
        
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_PROMINENT
        

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   If you set _enabled_ as true, the blur-effect for the widget is enabled.
*   If you set _enabled_ as false, the blur-effect for the widget is disabled.
*   If you specify _value_ as less than 0, the value is taken as 0.
    
*   If you specify _value_ as greater than 100, the value is taken as 100.

### ### Limitations

*   For Android:
    *   If a FlexContainer or a FlexScrollContainer contains a Map widget, the blur-effect is not applied to the map.
        
    *   If a FlexContainer or a FlexScrollContainer contains a Browser or Video widget, the blur-effect is applied but does not get updated. For example, when the video starts playing, the new rendered frame does not get displayed with the blur-effect.
        
    *   Even if you apply 100% blur for widgets that display any text( such as Label or Calendar widgets), the text on these widgets is not blurred. This is a Native Android limitation. To generate the blur effect for the text, apply a skin with darker background to the Label or Calendar widget. This is true even when the widgets are placed in a FlexContainer with blur effect and the widgets do not have a skin.
    *   Blur effect will not work on widgets added inside BOX containers.

### Example 1

To dynamically set the blur-effect for any widget, such as a FlexContainer, use the following code.

```
//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the blur property for FlexContainer widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the 
blur property for other applicable widgets.*/

Form1.myFlexContainer.blur = {
    "enabled": true,
    "value": 60
};

```

### Example 2

To dynamically set the blur-effect for any widget, such as a FlexContainer in iOS, use the following code.

```
Form1.widget1.blur = {
    "enabled": true,
    "value": 60,
    "style": constants.BLUR_EFFECT_DARK
};

It determines the height of the widget and measured along the y-axis.

The height property determines the height of the widget’s bounding box. The value may be set using DP (Device Independent Pixels), Percentage, or Pixels. For supported widgets, the height may be derived from either the widget or container’s contents by setting the height to “preferred”.

### Syntax

```

height
```

### Type

Number, String, and Constant

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

Following are the available measurement options:

*   %: Specifies the values in percentage relative to the parent dimensions.
*   px: Specifies the values in terms of device hardware pixels.
*   dp: Specifies the values in terms of device independent pixels.
*   default: Specifies the default value of the widget.
*   voltmx.flex.USE\_PREFERED\_SIZE: When this option is specified, the layout uses preferred height of the widget as height and preferred size of the widget is determined by the widget and may varies between platforms.

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the height property for widgets by using DP, Percentage and Pixels.
frmHome.button1.height="50dp";

frmHome.button1. height="10%";

<details close markdown="block"><summary>retainFlowHorizontalAlignment Property</summary>

* * *

This property is used to convert Flow Horizontal Left to Flow Horizontal Right.

> **_Note:_** Locale-level configurations take priority when invalid values are given to this property, or if it is not defined.

The mirroring widget layout properties should be defined as follows.

```
function getIsFlexPositionalShouldMirror(widgetRetainFlexPositionPropertiesValue) {
    return (isI18nLayoutConfigEnabled &&
    localeLayoutConfig[defaultLocale]
    ["mirrorFlexPositionalProperties"] == true &&
    !widgetRetainFlexPositionPropertiesValue);
}
```

The following table illustrates how widgets consider Local flag and Widget flag values.

| Properties | Local Flag Value | Widget Flag Value | Action |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Mirror/retain FlexPositionProperties | true | true | Use the designed layout from widget for all locales. Widget layout overrides everything else. |
| Mirror/retain FlexPositionProperties | true | false | Use Mirror FlexPositionProperties since locale-level Mirror is true. |
| Mirror/retain FlexPositionProperties | true | not specified | Use Mirror FlexPositionProperties since locale-level Mirror is true. |
| Mirror/retain FlexPositionProperties | false | true | Use the designed layout from widget for all locales. Widget layout overrides everything else. |
| Mirror/retain FlexPositionProperties | false | false | Use the Design/Model-specific default layout. |
| Mirror/retain FlexPositionProperties | false | not specified | Use the Design/Model-specific default layout. |
| Mirror/retain FlexPositionProperties | not specified | true | Use the designed layout from widget for all locales. Widget layout overrides everything else. |
| Mirror/retain FlexPositionProperties | not specified | false | Use the Design/Model-specific default layout. |
| Mirror/retain FlexPositionProperties | not specified | not specified | Use the Design/Model-specific default layout. |

<details close markdown="block"><summary>right Property</summary>

* * *

This property determines the lower right corner of the widget and is measured from the right bounds of the parent container.

The right property determines the position of the right edge of the widget’s bounding box. The value may be set using DP (Device Independent Pixels), Percentage, or Pixels. In freeform layout, the distance is measured from the left edge of the parent container. In flow-vertical layout, value is ignored. In flow-horizontal layout, the value is ignored.

The right property is used only if the width property is not provided.

### Syntax

```

right
```

### Type

String

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

If the layoutType is set as voltmx.flex.FLOW\_HORIZONTAL, the right property is measured from left edge of the right sibling widget. The horizontal space between two widgets is measured from right of the left sibling widget and left of the right sibling widget.

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the right property for widgets by using DP, Percentage and Pixels.
frmHome.widgetID.right = "50dp";

frmHome.widgetID.right = "10%";

frmHome.widgetID.right = "10px";

<details close markdown="block"><summary>rippleBackground Property</summary>

* * *

Defines the ripple background for a Button Widget.

### Syntax

```

rippleBackground
```

### Type

JSObject

### Parameters

#### rippleColor

Optional. Defines the color for the ripples.

You can define the ripple color in the RGBA format, where the R, G, and B range from 00 to ff, and the A (transparency) ranges from 00 (zero percent) to 64 (100 percent). Or, you can define the rippleColor as a key-value pair for each view state. The keys allowed are normal and pressed.

#### contenLayers

Optional. Array of two JS Objects. Each JS Object contains following key-value pairs to define a layer for ripple background. You can define the background for the ripple as a skin or as a background color.

**background**

Defines the background for the ripples. You can define the color in the RGBA format, where the R, G, and B range from 00 to ff, and the A (transparency) ranges from 00 (zero percent) to 64 (100 percent). Or, you can specify a skin as the background.

**backgroundType**

Defines the type of a background. You can define:

_RIPPLE\_CONTENT\_LAYER\_COLOR_: Background as color in the RGBA format.

_RIPPLE\_CONTENT\_LAYER\_SKIN_: Background as a skin.

**Mask**

Defines the bounds for the ripple animation. The property takes the Boolean value and by default is set to false.

**padding**

Defines the space around the ripple background. Specify an array of four integers \[left, top, right, bottom\]

**paddingInPixel**

Defines whether the units of specified padding values should be in pixels or in percentage. The property takes the Boolean value.

_true_: Indicates the specified padding values should be in pixels.

_false_: Indicates the specified padding values should be in percentage.

#### paddingMode

Defines how layer padding should affect the bounds of subsequent layers. You can define:

_RIPPLE\_PADDING\_MODE\_NEST_: Nests each layer inside padding of the previous layer.

_RIPPLE\_PADDING\_MODE\_STACK_: Stacks each layer on top of the previous layer. This is the default value.

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

If you set rippleBackground, skin, and focusSkin properties to the Button Widget through a constructor, the rippleBackground property takes the priority. Later, if you modify or set the skin properties such as skin, focusSkin, pressedSkin, and disabledSkins dynamically, the skin properties will take priority.

### Example

Setting the rippleBackground property on an existing widget

```
form1.Btn1.rippleBackground = {
    rippleColor: "ffff0000",
    contentLayers: [{
        background: "ffffff00",
        backgroundType: constants.RIPPLE_CONTENT_LAYER_COLOR,
        mask: false,
        padding: [10, 10, 10, 10]
    }, {
        background: btnSkin,
        backgroundType: constants.RIPPLE_CONTENT_LAYER_SKIN,
        mask: true
    }],

<details close markdown="block"><summary>shadowColor Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the color for the shadow of the widget.

### Syntax

```

shadowColor
```

### Type

Color constant or Hexadecimal number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   Colors can be specified using a 6 digit or an 8-digit hex value with alpha position. For example, ffff65 or ffffff00.
*   When the 4-byte color format (RGBA) string is used, an alpha (A) value of 65 specifies that the color is transparent. If the value is 00, the color is opaque. The Alpha value is in percentage and must be given in the hexadecimal value for the color (100% in hexadecimal value is 65).  
    For example, red complete opaque is FF000000. Red complete transparent is FF000065. The values 0x and # are not allowed in the string.
*   A color constant is a String that is defined at the theme level. Ensure that you append the **$** symbol at the beginning of the color constant.
*   This property does not have a default value.
*   This property has more priority than (and overrides) the shadow property of the configured skin. Even if there is no skin configured for the widget, this property updates the skin.

### Example

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have the shadowColor property.

```
Form1.btn1.shadowColor = "ea5075";

### Remarks

*   For a Segment, the **widgetSwipeMove** Property is configured while setting the data of the Segment.

> **_Note:_** It is not recommended to assign the widgetSwipeMove property on a top Flex container of the segment template widget.

### Limitations

*   When a translation animation is applied to the same widget that has **widgetSwipeMove** already configured, the action which has been performed last takes precedence. For example, if you have set a translation animation on a FlexContainer and then set the _widgetSwipeMove_ property, the actions set in _widgetSwipeMove_ take precedence over the translation animation.
*   The state of the swipe transition of the widget is not retained.
*   In a Segment, the _widgetSwipeMove_ Property must be configured for the rows so that they reset to the previous position.

*   If the widgetSwipeMove property is configured on a top level Flex container of a segment template, the onRowClick event will not be triggered. - Applicable on iOS, Android, and SPA.
*   Android limitation: On Android devices, when the user lifts their finger, the transition occurs immediately.

### Example

Following is a code snippet for a mail app. Here we have used a Segment for listing the mail and the _widgetSwipeMove_ Property has been configured for the _SwipeFlex_ FlexContainer.

```
//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.  
//Here, we have shown how to use the widetSwipeMove property for Button widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the 
widgetSwipeMove property for other applicable widgets.*/  
//### Example of a swipe move configuration.  
var swipeMoveConfig = {
 "translate": true,
 "Xboundaries": ["-60%", "60%"],
 "swipeLeft": [{
  "translateRange": ["-60%", "0%"],
  "callback": null,
  "translatePos": "-60%",
  "translate": true
 }, {
  "translateRange": ["0%", "60%"],
  "callback": null,
  "translatePos": "0%",
  "translate": true
 }],
 "swipeRight": [{
  "translateRange": ["-60%", "0%"],
  "callback": null,
  "translatePos": "0%",
  "translate": true
 }, {
  "translateRange": ["0%", "60%"],
  "callback": this.onCallback1,
  "translatePos": "60%",
  "translate": true
 }]
};  
  
this.view.myButton.widgetSwipeMove=swipeMoveConfig;  

```

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>width Property</summary>

* * *

This property determines the width of the widget and is measured along the x-axis.

The width property determines the width of the widget’s bounding box. The value may be set using DP (Device Independent Pixels), Percentage, or Pixels. For supported widgets, the width may be derived from either the widget or container’s contents by setting the width to “preferred”.

### Syntax

```

width
```

### Type

Number, String, and Constant

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

Following are the options that can be used as units of width:

*   %: Specifies the values in percentage relative to the parent dimensions.
*   px: Specifies the values in terms of device hardware pixels.
*   dp: Specifies the values in terms of device independent pixels.
*   default: Specifies the default value of the widget.
*   voltmx.flex.USE\_PREFERED\_SIZE: When this option is specified, the layout uses preferred width of the widget as width and preferred size of the widget is determined by the widget and may varies between platforms.

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the width property for widgets by using DP, Percentage and Pixels.
frmHome.widgetID.width = "50dp";

frmHome.widgetID.width = "10%";

frmHome.widgetID.width = "10px";
```

### Platform Availability

*   Available in the IDE
*   iOS, Android, Windows, SPA, and Desktop Web

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>zIndex Property</summary>

* * *

This property specifies the stack order of a widget. A widget with a higher zIndex is always in front of a widget with a lower zIndex.

The zIndex property is used to set the stack, or layer order of a widget. Widgets with higher values will appear “over”, or “on top of” widgets with lower values. Widgets layered over other widgets will override any interaction events tied to widgets beneath. Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets in the VoltMX Iris hierarchy, inside of a flexContainer or form. The zIndex property accepts only positive values.

### Syntax

```

zIndex
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The default value for this property is 1.

> **_Note:_** Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets inside the FlexContainer. If zIndex is same for group of overlapping widgets then widget order decides the order of overlapping. The last added widget is displayed on top.

From VoltMX Iris V9 SP2 FP7, developers can configure the Z Index value for a Responsive Web app as **Auto** or **Custom**. When the selected Z Index value is **Auto**, the default Z Index value of 1 is applied. When the selected Z Index value is **Custom**, developers can specify a desired numeric value.

Prior to the V9 SP2 FP7 release, the default value for the Z Index was **1**. When developers imported any third-party libraries with the Z index set as **Auto**, content overflow was disabled as the value of Auto is less than 1.

> **_Note:_** The Z Index value Auto is supported only when the Enable JS Library mode is configured as unchecked.

For existing components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Custom** with **1** as the value.

For new components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Auto** or **1** based on the project level settings.

> **_Note:_** If ModalContainer property is set to true in any of the FlexContainer widget, the Z Index value of that container and all of its parent containers should be set to **Custom**.

**voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO** : Constant to configure the Z Index value as **auto** programmatically.

```
//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto  
 var flx = new voltmx.ui.FlexContainer({ 
  "id": "flx"
  "zIndex": voltmx.flex.ZINDEX_AUTO
});

```
```
//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto
flx.zIndex = voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO;

```

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the zIndex property for widgets.  
frmHome.widgetID.zIndex = 300;
```
