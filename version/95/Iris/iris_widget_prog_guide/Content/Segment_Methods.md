===================

This section provides the methods associated with the SegmentUI widget. You can use these methods across all platforms.

> **_Note:_** The methods described in this section can be used only after you specify the mapping information between the widget IDs and the keys in the data using the [widgetDataMap](Segment_Properties.md#widgetDa) property.

The animation methods in this section help you apply 2D and 3D animations and transforms to the segment rows. Animations get applied to the rows only in the visible region. These methods adhere to animation modes defined as part of animation definition. You can make animation callbacks that are defined as part of animations. The animation methods work only at the segment level.

Positional and dimensional animations can be applied to individual row elements, but not supported at segment row level.

> **_Note:_** These animations apply only for the TABLEVIEW type.

Additionally, you can also specify the _Meta Info_ for the rows as explained in [data](Segment_Properties.md#data) property.

* * *


<details close markdown="block"><summary>addAll Method</summary>

* * *

This method allows you to add new data to the segment.

### Syntax
```

addAll(data)
```

### Parameters

data

Specifies an array to represent data as key value pairs. The format of the array of data is explained in [data](Segment_Properties.md#data) property of segment basic properties.

animation

Optional. This parameter is used to associate an animation with the item described by data.

The animation parameter has three parameters:

definition

An object defined using the voltmx.ui.createAnimation() API. Refer to voltmx.ui.createAnimation in the API programmers Guide for more details.

config

As defined in Animation Configuration. For more information, please see the `AnimationConfiguration` object documentation in the [API Developer's Guide](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/introduction.md).

callbacks

A dictionary that represents JavaScript functions that work as animation call backs. For more information, see `AnimationConfiguration` object documentation in the [API Developer's Guide](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/introduction.md).

### Remarks

The new data is appended to the existing data. If the segment has no data, the new data is placed in the segment.

Using this method, you cannot add the rows to the existing sections.

Animations get applied to the rows only in the visible region and ignored if the rows are in the invisible region.

You can apply specific animations to the displaced rows using the [onRowDisplay](#onRowDisplay) method.

If the animation property is defined in the addAll method, the animation will be applied to all elements added to the row.

The widget/row model will be updated based on the animation fill modes, so that the widget/row would always show the appropriate values. Note that your app must provide rowTemplateId as an empty object in the data object of a row to update the row model.

### Example

```

//Sample code to use addAll method without animation  
formSegment.mysegment.addAll([{
    dataId1: "data1",
    dataId2: "data2",
    dataId3: "data3"
}, {
    dataId1: "datax",
    dataId2: "datay",
    dataId3: "dataz",
    template: box1
}]);  
//Sample code to use addAll method with animation  
formSegment.mysegment.addAll([{
        dataId1: "data1",
        dataId2: "data2",
        dataId3: "data3"
    }, {
        dataId1: "datax",
        dataId2: "datay",
        dataId3: "dataz",
        template: box1
    }],
    animation 
);

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>addDataAt Method</summary>

* * *

Allows you to add one row of data at a given index or within a section.

### Syntax
```

addDataAt(data,rowIndex,sectionIndex)
```

### Parameters

data

Specifies the JSObject to represent data as key value pairs. The format of the array of data is explained in [data](Segment_Properties.md#data) property of segment basic properties.

Row data can also have the standard template key to indicate a new template for this added row. However it is developer responsibility to ensure widgetdatamap covers the widgets present in the new template.

rowIndex

Specifies the Index of the row within the section if the _sectionIndex_ is mentioned. If the _sectionIndex_ is not mentioned, the _rowIndex_ is treated in absolute terms independent of sections.

> > **_Note:_** Sections should not be counted as rows when calculating the _rowIndex_.

Index is '0' based in JavaScript and should be less than "n", where "n" is the number of existing rows within the section if _sectionIndex_ is mentioned. If the _sectionIndex_ is not mentioned "n" is the total number of rows in a segment.

If the _rowIndex_ mentioned is greater than "n", then row is added at the end of the segment or at the end of the section depending on the _sectionIndex_.

sectionIndex

Optional. Specifies the Index of the section. If the index is not mentioned, the _rowIndex_ will be treated in absolute terms.

> **_Note:_** In Android platform, the `sectionIndex` parameter is a mandatory parameter.

animation

Optional. This parameter is used to associate an animation at given operation.

The animation parameter has three parameters:

definition

An object defined using voltmx.ui.createAnimation() API. Refer to voltmx.ui.createAnimation in the API programmers Guide for more details.

config

As defined in Animation Configuration. For more information, please see the `AnimationConfiguration` object documentation in the [API Developer's Guide](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/introduction.md).

callbacks

A dictionary that represents JavaScript functions that work as animation call backs. For more information, see `AnimationConfiguration` object documentation in the [API Developer's Guide](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/introduction.md).

### Remarks

The new data is placed before the index. The existing data is pushed to the next row.

Animations get applied to the rows only in the visible region and ignored if the rows are in the invisible region.

You can apply specific animations to the displaced rows using the [onRowDisplay](#onRowDisplay) method.

The widget/ row model will be updated based on the animation fill modes, so that the widget/row would always show the appropriate values. Note that your app must provide rowTemplateId as an empty object in the data object of a row to update the row model

For example, the syntax to get the label text is `segment.selectedValue.label(text)`. Earlier this was written as `segment.selectedValue.label.text`.

### Example

```

/*Sample code to use addDataAt method without animation. In this sample code, the data is added above the 15th Index position in the first section of the Segment, mySegment.*/  
formSegment.mysegment.addDataAt(dataObj1, 15);  
  
/*Sample code to use addDataAt method with animation. In this sample code, the data is added above the 15th Index position in the first section of the Segment, mySegment.*/  
formSegment.mysegment.addDataAt(dataObj1, 15, animation);  
  
/*Sample code to use addDataAt method in Android platform. In this sample code, the data is added above the 15th index position in the zeroth section of mySegment Segment.*/  
formSegment.mysegment.addDataAt(dataObj1, 15,0);

*   sectionIndex \[number\] : section index of the segui where gesture was recognised. (Applicable to gestures added to segUI rows)

It is not recommend to define gestures for widgets that have a default behavior associated with it.

If you click (tap) a button (any clickable widget), the default behavior is to trigger an onClick event. If you define a Tap gesture on such widgets, the gesture closure is executed in addition to the onClick event.

If you swipe a larger form, the default behavior is to scroll up and down depending on the direction in which you swipe. If you define a SWIPE gesture on such forms, the gesture closure gets executed in addition to scrolling the form.

If you swipe a Segmented UI with huge number of rows, the default behavior is to scroll the Segmented UI. If you define a SWIPE gesture on such segments, the gesture closure gets executed in addition to scrolling the form.

### Gestures can be added only for the following widgets:

*   Flex Container
    
*   Flex Scroll Container.
    

In the android platform, the top and bottom gestures work only when the scrolling is disabled for Form and parent scrolling containers. By default, the scrolling is enabled for the Form and scrolling containers.

*   RIGHTTAP applicable only to Windows 10
*   ROTATION is not supported on android.

### Example

```
 
//Sample code to add Gestures to the frmGestures FlexForm.
//Code to add DOUBLE TAP gesture to the frmGestures, FlexForm.
var doubletp = {
 fingers: 1,
 taps: 2
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(1, doubletp, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add SINGLE TAP gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var singleTp = {
 fingers: 1,
 taps: 1
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(1, singleTp, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add SWIPE gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var swipeForm = {
 fingers: 1,
 swipedistance: 50,
 swipevelocity: 75
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(2, swipeForm, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add LONGPRESS gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var longPressForm = {
 pressDuration: 2
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(3, longPressForm, onGestureFunction);

function onGestureFunction(commonWidget, gestureInfo) {
 voltmx.print("The Gesture type is:" + gestureInfo.gestureType);

}

<details close markdown="block"><summary>addSectionAt Method</summary>

* * *

This method allows you to add one section with rows to the segment.

### Syntax
```
 
addSectionAt(data,sectionIndex)
```

### Parameters

data

Specifies an array to represent data as key value pairs. The format of the array of data is explained in [data](Segment_Properties.md#data) property of segment basic properties.

sectionIndex

Specifies the Index of the section.

Index is '0' based in JavaScript and should be less than "n", where "n" is the number of existing sections within the segment. If the index is greater than or equal to "n", then section is added at the end of the segment.

animation

Optional. This parameter is used to associate an animation at given operation.

The animation parameter has three parameters:

definition

An object defined using voltmx.ui.createAnimation() API. Refer to voltmx.ui.createAnimation in the API programmers Guide for more details.

config

As defined in Animation Configuration. For more information, please see the `AnimationConfiguration` object documentation in the [API Developer's Guide](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/introduction.md).

callbacks

A dictionary that represents JavaScript functions that work as animation call backs. For more information, see `AnimationConfiguration` object documentation in the [API Developer's Guide](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/introduction.md).

### Remarks

> **_Note:_** Sections and its rows can have the standard template key to indicate a new template for this added row. However it is developer responsibility to ensure widgetdatamap covers the widgets present in the new template.

Animations get applied to the rows only in the visible region and ignored if the rows are in the invisible region.

You can apply specific animations to the displaced rows using the [onRowDisplay](#onRowDisplay) method.

The widget/row model will be updated based on the animation fill modes, so that the widget/row would always show the appropriate values. Note that your app must provide rowTemplateId as an empty object in the data object of a row to update the row model

For example, the syntax to get the label text is `segment.selectedValue.label(text)`. In previous versions this was written as `segment.selectedValue.label.text`.

### Example

```

/*Sample code to use the addSectionAt method without animation. In this sample code, the data is added above the 15th Index position in the Segment,mySegment.*/  
  
formSegment.mysegment.addSectionAt(dataObj1, 15);  
  
/*Sample code to use addSectionAt method with animation. In this sample code, the data is added above the 15th Index position in the Segment,mySegment.*/  
  
formSegment.mysegment.addSectionAt (dataObj1, 15, animation);
```

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>animate Method</summary>

* * *

Applies an animation to the widget.

### Syntax
```

animate (animationObj, animateConfig, animationCallbacks)
```

### Parameters

_animationObj_

An `animation` object created using [voltmx.ui.createAnimation] function.

_animationConfig_

As defined in widget level animation section.

_animationCallbacks_

A JavaScript dictionary that contains key-value pairs. The following keys are supported.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| animationEnd | A JavaScript function that is invoked with the animation ends. For more information, see the **Remarks** section below. |
| animationStart | A JavaScript function that is invoked with the animation starts. For more information, see the **Remarks** section below. |

### Return Values

Returns a platform-specific handle to the animation. This handle currently not used, but is returned for possible future requirements use.

### Remarks

The callback for the `animationStart` key in the JavaScript object passed in this method's _animationCallbacks_ parameter has the following signature.

animationStart(source, animationHandle, elapsedTime);

where `source` is the widget being animated, `animationHandle` is the handle returned by the `applyAnimation` method, and `elapsedTime` is the amount of time the animation has been running in seconds, when this event is fired..

This event occurs at the start of the animation. If there is 'animation-delay' configured then this event will fire only after the delay period. This event gets called asynchronously.

The callback for the `animationEnd` key in the JavaScript object passed in this method's _animationCallbacks_ parameter has the following signature.

animationEnd(source, animationHandle, elapsedTime);

where source is the widget being animated, animationHandle is the handle returned by the applyAnimation method, and elapsedTime is the amount of time the animation has been running in seconds, when this event is fired.

This event occurs at the end of the animation. This event gets called asynchronously.

The `animate` method throws an Invalid Animation Definition Exception if animation definition, does not follow the dictionary structure expected. This method is ignored if it is called on a widget whose immediate parent is not FlexContainer or a FlexScrollContainer.

If the widget is not part of the currently visible view hierarchy, calling this method does nothing. Because this method is asynchronous and immediately returns, it does not wait for the animation to start or complete.

### Example

```

//Sample code of animation
function AnimateBoth() {
    var getFuncName = frm1.listbox18.selectedKey;
    if (getFuncName == "BothLT") {
        frm1.textbox26.animate(myAnimDefinition(),
            animConfiguration(), {});
    } else if (getFuncName == "BothTBL") {
        frm1.textbox26.animate(myAnimDefinitionsc1(),
            animConfiguration(), {});
    }
}
```

### Platform Availability

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>animateRows Method</summary>

* * *

This method associates animations with a specific row and its elements.

### Syntax
```

animateRows(rowAnimationConfig)
```

### Parameters

rowAnimationConfig

The array of elements and their animation definitions. This parameter has following fields:

  
| Argument | Description |
| --- | --- |
| rows | An array of one or more row objects. Each row object is in the following format: sectionIndex: The section number that contains the row. rowIndex: The row number. |
| widgetRef | An array of IDs of the widgets in the row to be animated. |
| animation | The animation object in the following format: definition: The animation definition object. config: The configuration definition object. callbacks: Optional callback functions. |

> **_Note:_** If the widget ID is not specified, the animation is applied at row level.

### Return Values

None

### Remarks

Using this method, you can apply animation to multiple rows so that all rows are animated simultaneously. The callbacks will be called only once for each row. You can even club the animations, but either at row level or at row elements level, not both at the same time. The rows being animated with this method should be in the visible region.

When a particular row is animated in a SegmentedUI widget, no animation is applied on the rows being displaced unless and until animation is applied. For example, suppose a Segment widget contains four rows and animation is applied only to the second row. When the second row gets animated, it which triggers displacement on the third and fourth rows. The displaced rows (3rd and 4th) may not get animated automatically unless animations are applied on them. In this case, you can apply specific animations to the displaced rows using the animateRows method.

The widget/row model will be updated based on the animation fill modes, so that the widget/row would always show the appropriate values. Note that your app must provide rowTemplateId as an empty object in the data object of a row to update the row model.

If your app calls this method on a SegmentedUI widget and the SegmentedUI widget is in a FlexContainer widget whose [autogrowMode](FlexContainer_Properties.md#autogrow) property is set to voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT, then animateRows will apply the animations for all of the specified rows. The animations will even be applied to rows outside the visible area.

If the orientation of the user's device changes while animations are being performed, the animations end immediately. Animations will also end immediately whenever your app calls any method or function that causes a complete refresh of the SegmentedUI widget. For example, if your app changes the SegmentedUI widget's data map while an animation is playing, the animation current animation will end and all subsequent animations are skipped.

### Example

```

var transformObject = voltmx.ui.makeAffineTransform();
transformObject.translate(10, 0);
transformObject.scale(0.1, 1);

var animationDef = {
 "100": {
  "transform": transformObject
 }
};
var animationConfig = {
 duration: 0.3,
 fillMode: voltmx.anim.FILL_MODE_FORWARDS
};
var row1 = {
 sectionIndex: 0,
 rowIndex: 1
};
var row2 = {
 sectionIndex: 0,
 rowIndex: 1
};
var animationDefObject = voltmx.ui.createAnimation(animationDef);
form1.segment1.animateRows({
 rows: [row1, row2],
 widgets: [myWidget],
 animation: {
  definition: animationDefObject,
  config: animationConfig
 }
});

<details close markdown="block"><summary>registerForPeekandPop Method</summary>

* * *

This method registers a widget to enable 3D Touch peek and pop gestures.

### Syntax
```

registerForPeekandPop(onPeekCallback, onPopCallback)
```

### Parameters

onPeekCallback

A callback function that is invoked when the user slightly presses (soft press) the widget.

Callback Syntax

onPeekCallback(widget)

Callback Input Parameters

_widget_

A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

Callback Return Values

  A PreviewInfoTable. See the Remarks section for a description of this table.

### Callback Example

```

function onPeekCallback(widget) {
    var previewInfoTable = {
        "peekForm": frmSecond,
        "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
        "contentSize": [320, 480]
    };
    return previewInfoTable;
}
```

onPopCallback (Optional)

A callback function that is invoked when the user further presses (hard press) the preview that is displayed for the widget.

Callback Syntax

onPopCallback(widget,peekForm)

Callback Input Parameters

_widget_

A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

_peekForm_

A form reference that is displayed as preview/peek.

Callback Return Values

  A form reference.

Callback Remarks

Use this callback to set the content for pop. The form handle returned by this callback is used for pop content. In general, the form that is used for preview is used for pop content also. If the pop callback is not implemented, peek disappears and the app returns to its previous state.

Callback Example

```

function onPopCallback(widget, peekForm) {
    // preview form used for pop also
    return peekForm;
}
```

### Remarks

A PreviewInfoTable has the following format.

**Name:** peekForm

**Description:** The form reference that will be displayed as preview. If an invalid form reference is given, the preview will not be shown.

**Type:** form reference

**Name:** focusRect (Optional)

**Description:** An array representing a rectangle in widgets view coordinates. If provided, this rectangle will be focused while its surrounding area will be blurred, indicating a preview is available for the widget. If not provided, entire view area of the widget will be focused. If either the width or height is zero, the widget's view width/height is used. The values are supported in percentage(with regard to widget bounds), dp, or pixels. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If an array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:** Array \[x, y, width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “0dp”, “200dp”, “300dp”\], \[“10%”, “10%”, “75%”, “50%”\], \[“10px”, “10px”, “200px”, “480px”\]

**Name:** contentSize (Optional)

**Description:** An array representing the preferred content size of the preview. This allows the user to adjust the preferred width/height dimensions of the preview. If not provided, the preview is shown with default values. If either the width or height is zero, the default preview width/height is used. It is recommended that one of the width/height values be zero for proper adjustment of the other value. For example, if width = 0, the height is adjustable and vice versa. Providing positive values simultaneously for both width and height will result in distorted appearance of preview. The values are supported in dp, pixels, and percentage(with regard to screen bounds). The actual width/height of the preview may vary slightly due to resizing per aspect ratio. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:** Array \[width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “100dp”\], \[“100%”, “0%”\], \[“0px”, “240px”\]

### Example of a PreviewInfoTable:

```

var previewInfoTable = {
    "peekForm": frmSecond,
    "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
    "contentSize": [320, 480]
};
```

### Return Values

None.

* * *

This method is used to remove all the existing rows and sections in a segment.

### Syntax
```

removeAll()
```

### Parameters

animation

Optional. This parameter is used to associate an animation at given operation.

The animation parameter has three parameters:

definition

An object defined using voltmx.ui.createAnimation() API. Refer to voltmx.ui.createAnimation in the API programmers Guide for more details.

config

As defined in Animation Configuration. For more information, please see the `AnimationConfiguration` object documentation in the [API Developer's Guide](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/introduction.md).

callbacks

A dictionary that represents JavaScript functions that work as animation call backs. For more information, see `AnimationConfiguration` object documentation in the [API Developer's Guide](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/introduction.md).

### Remarks

Animations get applied to the rows only in the visible region and ignored if the rows are in the invisible region.

You can apply specific animations to the displaced rows using the [onRowDisplay](#onRowDisplay) method.

The widget/row model will be updated based on the animation fill modes, so that the widget/row would always show the appropriate values. Note that your app must provide rowTemplateId as an empty object in the data object of a row to update the row model.

For example, the syntax to get the label text is `segment.selectedValue.label(text)`. Earlier this was written as `segment.selectedValue.label.text`.

### Example

```

//Sample code to use the removeAll method without animation.  
  
formSegment.mysegment.removeAll();

* * *

This method is used to remove the row at the given index or a row with in a section.

### Syntax
```

removeAt(rowIndex,sectionIndex)
```

### Parameters

rowIndex

Specifies the Index of the row within the section if the _sectionIndex_ is mentioned. It the _sectionIndex_ is not mentioed, the _rowIndex_ is treated in absolute terms independent of sections.

Index is '0' based in JavaScript and should be less than "n", where "n" is the number of existing rows within the section if _sectionIndex_ is mentioned. If the _sectionIndex_ is not mentioned "n" is the total number of rows in a segment.

If the _rowIndex_ mentioned is not within the limits then no action takes place.

sectionIndex

Optional. Specifies the Index of the section. If the index is not mentioned, the _rowIndex_ will be treated in absolute terms.

> **_Note:_** In Android platform, the `sectionIndex` parameter is a mandatory parameter.

animation

Optional. This parameter is used to associate an animation at given operation.

The animation parameter has three parameters:

definition

An object defined using voltmx.ui.createAnimation() API. Refer to voltmx.ui.createAnimation in the API programmers Guide for more details.

### Remarks

> **_Note:_** Sections should not be counted as rows when calculating the _rowIndex_.

If the index is not within the limits then _removeAt_ will be silent and doesn't yield any result.

Animations get applied to the rows only in the visible region and ignored if the rows are in the invisible region.

You can apply specific animations to the displaced rows using the [onRowDisplay](#onRowDisplay) method.

The widget/row model will be updated based on the animation fill modes, so that the widget/row would always show the appropriate values. Note that your app must provide rowTemplateId as an empty object in the data object of a row to update the row model.

For example, the syntax to get the label text is `segment.selectedValue.label(text)`. Earlier this was written as `segment.selectedValue.label.text`.

### Example

```

/*Sample code to use the removeAt method without animation. In this sample code, the removeAt method removes the data from the 15th Index position.*/  
formSegment.mysegment.removeAt(15);  
  
/*Sample code to use the removeAt method with animation to remove the data from the15th Index position.*/

<details close markdown="block"><summary>setAnimations Method</summary>

* * *

This method is used to associate animations to the rows at each operation.

### Syntax
```

setAnimations (animationConfig)
```

### Parameters

animationConfig

The animation definitions to be associated with the row.

### Return Values

None

### Remarks

The animationConfig parameter is an animation definition consisting of two arguments: _visible_ preserve">var var _invisible_. The _visible_ argument contains animation definition, callback, and configuration to be applied when a row is being brought to the visible canvas. The _invisible_ argument contains animation definition, callback, and configuration to be applied when a row is being moved out of the visible canvas.

The visible animations set using the setAnimations method are not invoked when the onRowDisplay method is used to define animations for elements.

When visible animation is set and segment is scrolled, because of which a row is brought to the visible region with the visible animation applied and the end state of visible animation is reflected on the row. This overrides the animation state set by the add/remove/set operations.

In Android and iOS platforms, the setAnimations method is not applicable for the AutoGrow Segment.

### Example

```

var transformObject = voltmx.ui.makeAffineTransform();
transformObject.translate(10, 0);
transformObject.scale(0.1, 1);
animationDef = {
    100: {
        "transform": transformObject
    }
};

animationConfig = {
    duration: 0.3,
    fillMode: voltmx.anim.FILL_MODE_FORWARDS
};
animationDefObject = voltmx.ui.createAnimation(
    animationDef
);
form.segment.setAnimations({

<details close markdown="block"><summary>setBadge Method</summary>

* * *

This method enables you to set the badge value to the given widget at the upper, right corner of the widget.

### Syntax
```

setBadge(badgeText)
```

### Parameters

badgeText \[String\] - Mandatory

Specifies the Text value that appears within the badge. If the length of the badgeText is greater than 1, the badge is a rounded rectangle. For example, if you specify the text of the badge as 88, the number appears in a rounded rectangular badge. If the length of the badge text is 1, the badge is always a circle. The badge can occupy up to 70% of the width of the parent widget. For example, on a button with a width of 100 pixels, a badge with about 100 characters will occupy only 70 pixels of the button width. The badge text is truncated and shows about 30 characters followed by three dots.

skin \[String\] - Optional

The parameter specifies the background color for the badge. The default color is red.

### Return Values

None

### Exceptions

Error

### Remarks

The color for the badge can be defined using a skin. The default color for the badge is red with white lettering.

If you pass an empty string as a parameter, the badge applied to the widget is cleared.

A Badge can be applied only to the FlexContainer Widget. To apply badge to other widgets, place the corresponding widget inside the FlexContainer, then apply Badge to the FlexContainer Widget. Also make sure that the clipBounds property of the FlexContainer are set to false.

If the badge value is a single character (a character or a number), the badge shape is a circle.

![](Resources/Images/widgetbadge.png)

If the badge value contains multiple characters, the badge shape is a rectangle with rounded corners and borders.

The badge can occupy a maximum of 70% width of the parent widget (widget on which badge is applied). For example, on a button with a width of 100 pixels, a badge with about 100 characters will occupy only 70 pixels of the button width. The badge value is truncated and about 30 characters followed by three dots.

When a badge is set, the widgets are re-arranged to accommodate the badge.

For iOS platform, this method is applicable on Box, Label, and Image widgets only.

For Android platform, this method is applicable on Button and Image widgets only.

### Example

```

//This is a generic method that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the setBadge Method for button widget.
//You need to make a corresponding call of the setBadge method for other applicable widgets.
function setBadge() {
    /*To set a badge value with skin "badgeSkin" on a button btn1
placed on a form frm1, use the following code: */
    frm1.btn1.setBadge("2", "badgeSkin");
}
//For instance, the corresponding setEnabled method call on the Label widget is as follows:
form.lbl1.setBadge("4", "badgeSkin");
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>setData Method</summary>

* * *

This method allows you to set new data to the segment.

### Syntax
```

setData(data)
```

### Parameters

data

Specifies an array to represent data as key value pairs. The format of the array of data is explained in [data](Segment_Properties.md#data) property of segment basic properties.

animation

Optional. This parameter is used to associate an animation at given operation.

The animation parameter has three parameters:

definition

An object defined using voltmx.ui.createAnimation() API. Refer to voltmx.ui.createAnimation in the API programmers Guide for more details.

config

As defined in Animation Configuration. For more information, please see the `AnimationConfiguration` object documentation in the [API Developer's Guide](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/introduction.md).

callbacks

A dictionary that represents JavaScript functions that work as animation call backs. For more information, see `AnimationConfiguration` object documentation in the [API Developer's Guide](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/introduction.md).

### Remarks

When you set new data, the existing data will be replaced with the new data. If the segment has no data, the new data is placed in the segment.

Updating a widget's data using the setData method as part of its own callbacks in a segment row's context results undefined behaviour.

Animations get applied to the rows only in the visible region and ignored if the rows are in the invisible region.

You can apply specific animations to the displaced rows using the [onRowDisplay](#onRowDisplay) method.

The widget/row model will be updated based on the animation fill modes, so that the widget/row would always show the appropriate values. Note that your app must provide rowTemplateId as an empty object in the data object of a row to update the row model.

For example, the syntax to get the label text is `segment.selectedValue.label(text)`. Earlier this was written as `segment.selectedValue.label.text`.

### Example

```

//Sample code to use setData method without animation.  
  
formSegment.mysegment.segment.setData([{

<details close markdown="block"><summary>setDataAt Method</summary>

* * *

Allows you to set data or modify an existing data of a row or within a section.

### Syntax
```

setDataAt(data,rowIndex,sectionIndex)
```

### Parameters

data

Specifies the JSObject to represent data as key value pairs. The format of the array of data is explained in [data](Segment_Properties.md#data) property of segment basic properties. Rowdata can have the standard template key to indicate a new template for this row. However it is developer responsibility to ensure widgetDataMap covers the widgets present in the new template.

rowIndex

Specifies the Index of the row within the section if the _sectionIndex_ is mentioned. If the _sectionIndex_ is not mentioed, the _rowIndex_ is treated in absolute terms independent of sections.

> > **_Note:_** Sections should not be counted as rows when calculating the _rowIndex_.

Index is '0' based in JavaScript and should be less than "n", where "n" is the number of existing rows within the section if _sectionIndex_ is mentioned. If the _sectionIndex_ is not mentioned "n" is the total number of rows in a segment.

If the rowIndex mentioned is not within the limits then no action takes place.

sectionIndex

Optional. Specifies the Index of the section. If the index is not mentioned, the _rowIndex_ will be treated in absolute terms.

> **_Note:_** In Android platform, the `sectionIndex` parameter is a mandatory parameter.

animation

Optional. This parameter is used to associate an animation at given operation.

The animation parameter has three parameters:

definition

An object defined using voltmx.ui.createAnimation() API. Refer to voltmx.ui.createAnimation in the API programmers Guide for more details.

config

As defined in Animation Configuration. For more information on animation configuration, please see the `AnimationConfiguration` object documentation in the [API Developer's Guide](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/introduction.md).

callbacks

A dictionary that represents JavaScript functions that work as animation call backs. For more information, see `AnimationConfiguration` object documentation in the [API Developer's Guide](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/introduction.md).

### Remarks

The existing data of the row will be replaced with the new set. In case the index is not valid and not falling in range 0 <= index <= N, where N is the total number of records then the operation is ignored.

Animations get applied to the rows only in the visible region and ignored if the rows are in the invisible region.

You can apply specific animations on the displaced rows using the [onRowDisplay](#onRowDisplay) method.

The widget/row model will be updated based on the animation fill modes, so that the widget/row would always show the appropriate values. Note that your app must provide rowTemplateId as an empty object in the data object of a row to update the row model.

For example, the syntax to get the label text is `segment.selectedValue.label(text)`. Earlier this was written as `segment.selectedValue.label.text`.

### Example

```

//Example of a data object that needs to be set in the 15th Index of the Segment.  
  
dataObj1 = {
    globaDdataId1: "label3",
    globaDataId2: "label4",
    globalDataId3: "label5"
};  
//Sample code to use setDataAt method without animation.  
formSegment.mysegment.setDataAt(dataObj1, 15);  
  
//Sample code to use setDataAt method with animation.  
formSegment.mysegment.setDataAt(dataObj1, 15, animation);  
  
/*Sample code to use setDataAt method in Android platform. In this sample code,the data is removed and new data is updated at the 15th-row index position in the zeroth section of mySegment Segment.*/  
formSegment.mysegment.setDataAt(dataObj1, 15,0);

<details close markdown="block"><summary>setOnPeek Method</summary>

* * *

This method sets and overrides the existing onPeekCallback for the widget.

### Syntax
```

setOnPeek(onPeekCallback)
```

### Parameters

onPeekCallback

A callback function that is invoked when the user slightly presses (soft press) the widget.

Callback Syntax

onPeekCallback(widget)

Callback Parameters

_widget_

A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

Callback Return Values

PreviewInfoTable. See the Remarks section for a description of this table.

### Callback Example

```

function onPeekCallback(widget, contextInfo) {
    var previewInfoTable = {
        "peekForm": frmSecond,
        "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
        "contentSize": [320, 480]
    };
    return previewInfoTable;
}
```

### Return Values

None.

### Remarks

A PreviewInfoTable has the following format.

**Name:** peekForm

**Description:** The form reference that will be displayed as preview. If an invalid form reference is given, the preview will not be shown.

**Type:** form reference

**Name:** focusRect (Optional)

**Description:** An array representing a rectangle in widgets view coordinates. If provided, this rectangle will be focused while its surrounding area will be blurred, indicating a preview is available for the widget. If not provided, entire view area of the widget will be focused. If either the width or height is zero, the widget's view width/height is used. The values are supported in percentage(with regard to widget bounds), dp, or pixels. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If an array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:**Array \[x, y, width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “0dp”, “200dp”, “300dp”\], \[“10%”, “10%”, “75%”, “50%”\], \[“10px”, “10px”, “200px”, “480px”\]

**Name:**contentSize (Optional)

**Description:**An array representing the preferred content size of the preview. This allows the user to adjust the preferred width/height dimensions of the preview. If not provided, the preview is shown with default values. If either the width or height is zero, the default preview width/height is used. It is recommended that one of the width/height values be zero for proper adjustment of the other value. For example, if width = 0, the height is adjustable and vice versa. Providing positive values simultaneously for both width and height will result in distorted appearance of preview. The values are supported in dp, pixels, and percentage(with regard to screen bounds). The actual width/height of the preview may vary slightly due to resizing per aspect ratio. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:**Array \[width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “100dp”\], \[“100%”, “0%”\], \[“0px”, “240px”\]

### Example of a PreviewInfoTable:

```

var previewInfoTable = {
    "peekForm": frmSecond,
    "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
    "contentSize": [320, 480]
};
```

### Example

```

function settingPeek() {
    Form1.setOnPeek(onMyPeekcallback);
}

function onMyPeekcallback(widgetref, contextInfo) {
    if (typeof(contextInfo) === undefined) {
        return null;
    }

    var previewInfoTable = {
        "peekForm": frmSecond,
        "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
        "contentSize": [320, 480]
    };
    return previewInfoTable;

}
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>setOnPop Method</summary>

* * *

This method overrides the existing onPopCallback for the widget.

### Syntax
```

setOnPop(onPopCallback)
```

### Parameters

onPopCallback

A callback function that is invoked when the user slightly presses (soft press) the widget.

Callback Syntax

onPopCallback(widget,peekForm)

Callback Parameters

_widget_

 A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

_peekForm_

 A form reference that is displayed as preview/peek.

Callback Return Values

 A form reference.

Callback Remarks

 Use this callback to set the content for pop. The form handle returned by this callback is used for pop content. In general, the form that is used for preview is used for pop content also. If the pop callback is not implemented, peek disappears and the app returns to its previous state.

### Callback Example

```

function onPopCallback(widget, peekForm) {
    // preview form used for pop also
    return peekForm;
}
```

### Return Values

None.

### Example

```

function settingPop() {

<details close markdown="block"><summary>setSectionAt Method</summary>

* * *

This method allows you to set or modify a section with rows to the segment.

### Syntax
```

setSectionAt(arrayofdata,sectionIndex)
```

### Parameters

arrayofdata

Specifies an array that represents the section data as key value pairs. The format of the array of data is explained in [data](Segment_Properties.md#data) property of segment basic properties. Sections and its rows can have standard template key to indicate a new template for this added row. However it is developer responsibility to ensure widgetdatamap covers the widgets represent in the new template.

sectionIndex

Specifies the Index of the section.

Index is '0' based in JavaScript and should be less than "N", where "N" is the number of existing sections within the segmentedUI widget. If not. setSectionAt will be silent and does not yield any results.

### Remarks

When you set new data, the existing data will be replaced with the new data. If the segment has no data, the new data is placed in the segment.

Animations get applied to the rows only in the visible region and ignored if the rows are in the invisible region.

You can apply specific animations to the displaced rows using the [onRowDisplay](#onRowDisplay) method.

The widget/row model will be updated based on the animation fill modes, so that the widget/row would always show the appropriate values. Note that your app must provide rowTemplateId as an empty object in the data object of a row to update the row model.

For example, the syntax to get the label text is `segment.selectedValue.label(text)`. Earlier this was written as `segment.selectedValue.label.text`.

### Example

```

//Example of a data object that needs to be set in the 2nd Section Index of the Segment.  
  
var dataObj1 = [{
    "lbl": "Row 0",
    "btn": "Btn Row - 0",
    "rowtemplateId": {}
