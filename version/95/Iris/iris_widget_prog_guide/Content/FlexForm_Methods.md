================

The FlexForm widget has the following methods associated with it:

* * *


<details close markdown="block"><summary>add Method</summary>

* * *

This method is used to add widgets to the FlexForm. When the widgets are added to the current visible FlexForm, then the changes will reflect immediately. Adding a widget to the FlexForm hierarchy, which is already a part of the other widget hierarchy, will lead to undefined behaviors. You have to explicitly remove the widget from one hierarchy before adding it to another FlexForm.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

add(widgetArray);
```

<b>Parameters</b>

widgetArray \[JSObject\]

Comma separated list of widgets.

formid \[widgetref\]

Handle to the widget instance.

<b>Return Values</b>

None

<b>Exceptions</b>

WidgetError

<b>Example</b>

```
//Sample code to invoke add method by using a FlexForm.
var myFlexScroll = new voltmx.ui.FlexScrollContainer({
 "id": "myFlexScroll",
 "top": "5dp",
 "left": "6dp",

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>addAt Method</summary>

* * *

This method is used to add widgets to the Form container at the specified index. Widget is prepended if index <0 and appended at the end of the container if the index > size+1. Size is the number of widgets already present in the container. If a new widget is added or removed will reflect immediately from the form hierarchy model perspective, however the changes are displayed when the Form appears. When the widgets are added to the current visible form, then the changes will reflect immediately. Adding a widget to the Form or Box hierarchy, which is already a part of the other widget hierarchy, will lead to undefined behaviors. You have to explicitly remove the widget from one hierarchy before adding it to another Form or Box.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

addAt(widgetref,index);
```

<b>Parameters</b>

widgetref

Reference of the name of the widget.

index \[Number\]

Index number at which the widget is to be added.

<b>Return Values</b>

None

<b>Exceptions</b>

WidgetError

<b>Example</b>

```
//Sample code to invoke addAt method by using a FlexForm.  
var myButton = new voltmx.ui.Button({
 "focusSkin": "defBtnFocus",

*   continuousEvents \[Boolean\] indicates if callback should be called continuously every change beginning from the time the gesture is recognized to the time it ends.

The syntax for the _onGestureClosure_callback function are:

\[function\] - Mandatory

Specifies the function that needs to be executed when a gesture is recognized.

This function will be raised asynchronously and has the following Syntax:

onGestureClosure(widgetRef, gestureInfo, context)

*   widgetRef - specifies the handle to the widget on which the gesture was recognized.
*   gestureInfo - Table with information about the gesture. The contents of this table vary based on the gesture type.
*   context - Table with SegmentedUI row details.

gestureInfo table has the following key-value pairs:

*   gestureType \[number\] – indicates the gesture type; 1 for TAP, 2 for SWIPE, and 3 for LONGPRESS,4 for PAN, 5 for ROTATION, 6 for PINCH and 7 for RIGHTTAP
*   gesturesetUpParams \[object\] – specifies the set up parameters passed while adding the gesture recognizer

*   sectionIndex \[number\] : section index of the segui where gesture was recognised. (Applicable to gestures added to segUI rows)

It is not recommend to define gestures for widgets that have a default behavior associated with it.

If you click (tap) a button (any clickable widget), the default behavior is to trigger an onClick event. If you define a Tap gesture on such widgets, the gesture closure is executed in addition to the onClick event.

If you swipe a larger form, the default behavior is to scroll up and down depending on the direction in which you swipe. If you define a SWIPE gesture on such forms, the gesture closure gets executed in addition to scrolling the form.

If you swipe a Segmented UI with huge number of rows, the default behavior is to scroll the Segmented UI. If you define a SWIPE gesture on such segments, the gesture closure gets executed in addition to scrolling the form.

Gestures can be added only for the following widgets:

*   Flex Container
    
*   Flex Scroll Container.
    

In the android platform, the top and bottom gestures work only when the scrolling is disabled for Form and parent scrolling containers. By default, the scrolling is enabled for the Form and scrolling containers.

*   RIGHTTAP applicable only to Windows 10
*   ROTATION is not supported on android.

<b>Example</b>

```
 //Sample code to add Gestures to the frmGestures FlexForm.
//Code to add DOUBLE TAP gesture to the frmGestures, FlexForm.
var doubletp = {
 fingers: 1,
 taps: 2
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(1, doubletp, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add SINGLE TAP gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var singleTp = {
 fingers: 1,
 taps: 1
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(1, singleTp, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add SWIPE gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var swipeForm = {
 fingers: 1,
 swipedistance: 50,
 swipevelocity: 75
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(2, swipeForm, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add LONGPRESS gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var longPressForm = {
 pressDuration: 2
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(3, longPressForm, onGestureFunction);

function onGestureFunction(commonWidget, gestureInfo) {
 voltmx.print("The Gesture type is:" + gestureInfo.gestureType);

<details close markdown="block"><summary>animate Method</summary>

* * *

Applies an animation to the widget.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

animate (animationObj, animateConfig, animationCallbacks);
```

<b>Parameters</b>

_animationObj_

An `animation` object created using [voltmx.ui.createAnimation](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/voltmx.ui_functions.md#createAn?TocPath=References|voltmx.ui_Namespace|Functions|_____5) function.

_animationConfig_

As defined in widget level animation section.

_animationCallbacks_

A JavaScript dictionary that contains key-value pairs. The following keys are supported.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| animationEnd | A JavaScript function that is invoked with the animation ends. For more information, see the **Remarks** section below. |
| animationStart | A JavaScript function that is invoked with the animation starts. For more information, see the **Remarks** section below. |

<b>Return Values</b>

Returns a platform-specific handle to the animation. This handle currently not used, but is returned for possible future requirements use.

<b>Remarks</b>

The callback for the `animationStart` key in the JavaScript object passed in this method's _animationCallbacks_ parameter has the following signature.

animationStart(source, animationHandle, elapsedTime);

where `source` is the widget being animated, `animationHandle` is the handle returned by the `applyAnimation` method, and `elapsedTime` is the amount of time the animation has been running in seconds, when this event is fired..

This event occurs at the start of the animation. If there is 'animation-delay' configured then this event will fire only after the delay period. This event gets called asynchronously.

The callback for the `animationEnd` key in the JavaScript object passed in this method's _animationCallbacks_ parameter has the following signature.

animationEnd(source, animationHandle, elapsedTime);

where source is the widget being animated, animationHandle is the handle returned by the applyAnimation method, and elapsedTime is the amount of time the animation has been running in seconds, when this event is fired.

This event occurs at the end of the animation. This event gets called asynchronously.

The `animate` method throws an Invalid Animation Definition Exception if animation definition, does not follow the dictionary structure expected. This method is ignored if it is called on a widget whose immediate parent is not FlexContainer or a FlexScrollContainer.

If the widget is not part of the currently visible view hierarchy, calling this method does nothing. Because this method is asynchronous and immediately returns, it does not wait for the animation to start or complete.

<b>Example</b>

```
//Sample code of animation
function AnimateBoth() {
    var getFuncName = frm1.listbox18.selectedKey;
    if (getFuncName == "BothLT") {
        frm1.textbox26.animate(myAnimDefinition(),
            animConfiguration(), {});
    } else if (getFuncName == "BothTBL") {
        frm1.textbox26.animate(myAnimDefinitionsc1(),
            animConfiguration(), {});
    }
}

<details close markdown="block"><summary>clone Method</summary>

* * *

When this method is used on a container widget, then all the widgets inside the container are cloned. This method takes an optional parameter. If the widgetid is not passed then the cloned copy will have the same ID as original widget.

If the widget ID is passed as a parameter then it will be prefixed to the existing ID and will assign it to cloned copy of the container. For all other widgets of the container and its child widgets.

For example, if the widget ID is "fc1" and the widget ID passed to clone API is "ref1", then the cloned widget ID will be "ref1fc1". For a child widget placed in a container with widget ID as "wid1", the cloned copy will have the widget ID as "ref1wid1".

<b>Exceptions</b> are not displayed if widget ID parameter is not unique. Instead when the cloned copy is added to the same form as of original container then it may lead to unexpected behaviors. So it is your responsibility to provide unique widget ID.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

clone();
```

<b>Parameters</b>

widgetId \[String\]

Optional. Reference of the name of the widget.

<b>Return Values</b>

Cloned copy of the widget.

<b>Exceptions</b>

None

<b>Remarks</b>

*   This method is not supported on SegmentedUI2 widget.
*   Gestures for the FlexContainer are not cloned. You have to reapply the gestures on the cloned object.
*   In Android platform, cloned Map widget will not work if prefix is not passed as parameter to the API.

*   To apply focusSkin for dynamically created widgets or cloned widgets, assign focusSkin dynamically after adding the widget to the form hierarchy. This is applicable for SPA and Desktop web platforms.
```
formid.widgetid.focusSkin = "skinname";
```
*   To apply hoverSkin for dynamically created widgets or cloned widgets, assign hoverSkin dynamically after adding the widget to the form hierarchy. This is applicable for the Desktop web platform.
```
formid.widgetid.hoverSkin = "skinname";
```

<b>Example</b>

```

//This is a generic method that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the clone Method for a FlexContainer widget.
//You need to make a corresponding call of the clone method for other applicable widgets.  
var flex2 = frmFlex.flexContainer1.clone();
//Here, flexContainer1 is a FlexContainer widget that is already present in frmFlex FlexForm.
frmFlex.add(flex2);
//For instance, the corresponding clone method call on the Label widget is as follows:
var myLabel=frmFlex.lbl1.clone();

<details close markdown="block"><summary>forceLayout Method</summary>

* * *

When this method is called, underlying OS layout cycle is forced to layout the widgets of the FlexContainer. FlexContainer does not issue layout as and when layout changes happen to the widgets inside FlexContainer.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

forceLayout();
```

<b>Parameters</b>

None

<b>Return Values</b>

None

<b>Exceptions</b>

WidgetError

<b>Remarks</b>

> **_Note:_** This method asynchronously forces the layout while method returns immediately.

The layout cycles of a FlexContainer are triggered automatically in the below cases:

*   Except in Android, at the end of JavaScript closure execution, if there are changes in the widgets of currently visible view hierarchy, that require layout cycles.
*   When a form and other top-level containers marked as FlexContainer get visible.
*   When there is a change in view hierarchy (addition or removal of widgets in the view hierarchy)
*   When a container size is changed, its layout is triggered or when device orientation is changed.
*   When you force the layout of the FlexContainer as needed using the forceLayout method.

Changing the widget layout properties does not mean layout cycles are automatically triggered. Layout manage can choose to cache the positions and dimensions of the widgets inside FlexContainer for performance reasons and reuse all valid cache values during the layout cycles.

The forceLayout should be called on the parent only when any of the positional or dimensional properties of any child widgets are modified. Other properties such as zIndex, backgroundColor, transform, and visibility does not need a forceLayout call.

When to Use

Case1: If you have a SegmentedUI inside a FlexForm and you want to change the SegmentedUI layout properties dynamically. In this case you have to call the forceLayout after configuring the new layout properties.

<b>Example</b>

```
//Sample code to invoke forceLayout method by using a FlexContainer widget.  
  
myForm.myFlexContainer.forceLayout();

```

<b>Parameters</b>

onPeekCallback

A callback function that is invoked when the user slightly presses (soft press) the widget.

Callback Syntax

```

onPeekCallback(widget);
```

Callback Input Parameters

_widget_

A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

Callback Return Values

  A PreviewInfoTable. See the Remarks section for a description of this table.

Callback Example

```
function onPeekCallback(widget) {
    var previewInfoTable = {
        "peekForm": frmSecond,
        "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
        "contentSize": [320, 480]
    };
    return previewInfoTable;
}
```

onPopCallback (Optional)

A callback function that is invoked when the user further presses (hard press) the preview that is displayed for the widget.

Callback Syntax

```

onPopCallback(widget,peekForm);
```

Callback Input Parameters

_widget_

A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

_peekForm_

A form reference that is displayed as preview/peek.

Callback Return Values

  A form reference.

Callback Remarks

Use this callback to set the content for pop. The form handle returned by this callback is used for pop content. In general, the form that is used for preview is used for pop content also. If the pop callback is not implemented, peek disappears and the app returns to its previous state.

Callback Example

```
function onPopCallback(widget, peekForm) {
    // preview form used for pop also
    return peekForm;
}
```

<b>Remarks</b>

A PreviewInfoTable has the following format.

**Name:** peekForm

**Description:** The form reference that will be displayed as preview. If an invalid form reference is given, the preview will not be shown.

**Type:** form reference

**Name:** focusRect (Optional)

**Description:** An array representing a rectangle in widgets view coordinates. If provided, this rectangle will be focused while its surrounding area will be blurred, indicating a preview is available for the widget. If not provided, entire view area of the widget will be focused. If either the width or height is zero, the widget's view width/height is used. The values are supported in percentage(with regard to widget bounds), dp, or pixels. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If an array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:** Array \[x, y, width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “0dp”, “200dp”, “300dp”\], \[“10%”, “10%”, “75%”, “50%”\], \[“10px”, “10px”, “200px”, “480px”\]

**Name:** contentSize (Optional)

**Description:** An array representing the preferred content size of the preview. This allows the user to adjust the preferred width/height dimensions of the preview. If not provided, the preview is shown with default values. If either the width or height is zero, the default preview width/height is used. It is recommended that one of the width/height values be zero for proper adjustment of the other value. For example, if width = 0, the height is adjustable and vice versa. Providing positive values simultaneously for both width and height will result in distorted appearance of preview. The values are supported in dp, pixels, and percentage(with regard to screen bounds). The actual width/height of the preview may vary slightly due to resizing per aspect ratio. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:** Array \[width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “100dp”\], \[“100%”, “0%”\], \[“0px”, “240px”\]

Example of a PreviewInfoTable:

```
var previewInfoTable = {
    "peekForm": frmSecond,
    "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
    "contentSize": [320, 480]

```

<b>Parameters</b>

onPeekCallback

A callback function that is invoked when the user slightly presses (soft press) the widget.

Callback Syntax

```

onPeekCallback(widget);
```

Callback Parameters

_widget_

A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

Callback Return Values

PreviewInfoTable. See the Remarks section for a description of this table.

Callback Example

```
function onPeekCallback(widget, contextInfo) {
    var previewInfoTable = {
        "peekForm": frmSecond,
        "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
        "contentSize": [320, 480]
    };
    return previewInfoTable;
}
```

<b>Return Values</b>

None.

<b>Remarks</b>

A PreviewInfoTable has the following format.

**Name:** peekForm

**Description:** The form reference that will be displayed as preview. If an invalid form reference is given, the preview will not be shown.

**Type:** form reference

**Name:** focusRect (Optional)

**Description:** An array representing a rectangle in widgets view coordinates. If provided, this rectangle will be focused while its surrounding area will be blurred, indicating a preview is available for the widget. If not provided, entire view area of the widget will be focused. If either the width or height is zero, the widget's view width/height is used. The values are supported in percentage(with regard to widget bounds), dp, or pixels. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If an array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:**Array \[x, y, width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “0dp”, “200dp”, “300dp”\], \[“10%”, “10%”, “75%”, “50%”\], \[“10px”, “10px”, “200px”, “480px”\]

**Name:**contentSize (Optional)

**Description:**An array representing the preferred content size of the preview. This allows the user to adjust the preferred width/height dimensions of the preview. If not provided, the preview is shown with default values. If either the width or height is zero, the default preview width/height is used. It is recommended that one of the width/height values be zero for proper adjustment of the other value. For example, if width = 0, the height is adjustable and vice versa. Providing positive values simultaneously for both width and height will result in distorted appearance of preview. The values are supported in dp, pixels, and percentage(with regard to screen bounds). The actual width/height of the preview may vary slightly due to resizing per aspect ratio. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:**Array \[width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “100dp”\], \[“100%”, “0%”\], \[“0px”, “240px”\]

Example of a PreviewInfoTable:

```
var previewInfoTable = {
    "peekForm": frmSecond,
    "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
    "contentSize": [320, 480]
};
```

<b>Example</b>

```
function settingPeek() {
    Form1.setOnPeek(onMyPeekcallback);
}

function onMyPeekcallback(widgetref, contextInfo) {
    if (typeof(contextInfo) === undefined) {
        return null;
    }

    var previewInfoTable = {
        "peekForm": frmSecond,
        "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
