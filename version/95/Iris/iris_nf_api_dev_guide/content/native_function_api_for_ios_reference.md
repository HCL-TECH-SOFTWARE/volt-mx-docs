Native Function API for iOS Reference
=====================================

Native Function APIs are JavaScript wrappers for Objective C and Android native APIs. They are generated from the source APIs, which means that they can be updated and released quickly when the target APIÂ changes. The feature gives you the flexibility to update your apps quickly. This also means that you can do almost anything using JavaScript in Iris that you can do using native APIs.

The reference topics describe the JavaScript APIs in detail. They also contain links to the source documentation for the APIs as hosted by Apple.
