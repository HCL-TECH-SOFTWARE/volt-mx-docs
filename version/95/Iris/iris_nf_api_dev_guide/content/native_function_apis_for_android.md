Native Function APIs for Android
================================

Native Function APIs are JavaScript wrappers for Objective C and Android native APIs. They are generated from the source APIs, which means that they can be updated and released quickly when the target APIÂ changes. This gives you the flexibility to update your apps quickly. This also means that you can do almost anything using JavaScript in Iris that you can do using native APIs.

These reference topics are created at the same time that the JavaScript wrappers are generated, and describe the JavaScript APIs in detail. They also contain links to the source documentation for the APIs as hosted by Google.
