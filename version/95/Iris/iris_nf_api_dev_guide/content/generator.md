Generator
=========

The Generator sample app is a complete Volt MX app for iOSÂ that you can build and run. It is an example of a bug tracking app for a manufacturing plant. It allows the user to log issues when machinery is malfunctioning. It was created for Iris 7.0, and has been updated to support the features of the Native Function API, particularly the Native Container widget which allows the use of the Apple SceneKit.

Sample App

The Generator app can be found on GitHub.
