ZipUnzip
========

ZipUnzip helps to package multiple files into a single compressed file, which takes less space in device memory and also takes less time to share. ZipUnzip also extracts the compressed files.

Using this feature, Android applications can:

*   Package a set of files into one single zipped file. You can also select the required files from a list of files and package.
*   View the files of a zipped file along with the file size.
*   Unzip the zipped files.
