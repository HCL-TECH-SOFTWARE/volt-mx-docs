Native Function API Developers' Guide
--------------------------------------

This document provides information regarding Native Function APIs for iOS and Android, which give you access to new or obscure device features that are platform-specific before they've become available in the cross platform APIs. The Native Function APIs provide access to native iOS and Android APIs from within your JavaScript code. You lose platform independence, but get access to specialized functionality not available in more generic ways.

Native Function APIs are JavaScript wrappers for Objective C and Android native APIs. They are generated from the source APIs, which means that they can be updated and released quickly when the target APIÂ changes. This gives you the flexibility to update your apps quickly. This also means that you can do almost anything using JavaScript in Iris that you can do using native APIs.
