Guidelines while using Images
-----------------------------

Following are the guidelines while using images.

*   During the design time, after placing the image, there is a property to set horizontal and vertical expansion either True or False. Set these properties to false to make sure that the image will not get stretched.
*   Ensure that platform specific images are provided in the respective platform specific folders of the “resources” folder.
*   While targeting the application for iOS platform, make sure to provide retina (@2x) images.
