## Volt MX Iris

### Storyboard View In Volt MX Iris 

Storyboard view in Volt MX Iris enables a user to view all the application forms in a single view, organize the application flow and manage the navigation logic. You can use this feature to define simple navigation actions between various forms in a project. You can also create forms within App Groups in Storyboard view.

### Volt MX Frame Work

The Volt MX test framework enables users to record any activity on the application and generate test scripts. Further, the dashboard provides an overview of the last five tests that have been executed and an option to play recorded tests, then automate these tests as part of the continuous testing lifecycle through our DevOps platform. The testing framework also allows you to build atomic test cases that can be reused as part of larger test suites and test plans.

### Client-Side Workflow

Easily create Client-side business logic using the new client-side workflow in Iris. The Client- side workflow can be launched from the Storyboard view and can be created following an event driven design in a workflow editor using drag & drop actions to design a visual workflow of the client side business rules.

### Rapid App Generation

Adding to its many existing productivity features, Iris now enables users to rapidly generate simple applications with CRUD based forms from objects in a database or a data model. In a few simple steps users can import data from an excel, csv or from a database and generate applications that allows users to view, create, update and delete data.

### Volt MX Collab

The Collab feature helps developers who use Git as the collaboration tool to avoid conflicts while working on the same Iris project. Collab notifies the developers who work on the same file or the same project and highlights possible conflicts.

For more information on this feature, click [here](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Collab.md).

### Generate An App Binary For The Volt MX App Viewer App

A new menu option, Customize Volt MX App, is added in the Build Menu of Volt MX Iris.

### ControllerActions Files In Gitignore

For a form created using the Reference Architecture, Volt MX Iris creates a controlleractions.js file corresponding to the form. When the project is hosted on GIT, during the commit process, as Volt MX Iris creates the controlleractions.js file every time Iris restarts, GIT commits will result in conflicts. To avoid these conflicts, the controlleractions.js file commit process is modified, and now the file will automatically be added to the .gitignore folder.
