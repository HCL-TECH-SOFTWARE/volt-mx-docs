Creation and Configuration of the Test App
==========================================

In this chapter, we will take you through the creation and configuration of the sample application in your Engagement Server. We will also walk you through the configuration steps that are needed to configure the SMS and Email provider information. Once the application is configured you will be able to receive email, SMS, and push notifications on your device. Note that this chapter will walk you through the steps for the application configuration that are needed to receive Android push notifications only.

It is assumed that you already have access to a trial account of Volt MX Foundry which has Engagement provisioned.

Creation and Configuration of Sample Application in Volt MX Engagement Server
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this section, we will take you thru the creation of a sample app in your Engagement Server. We will also walk you through the configuration steps that are needed to receive the push notifications on your Android device.

An application in the Engagement Server is needed for the subscriptions to be created. A subscription enables a push message to be sent and is associated with an application and a device combination. So, for one application you could have multiple device subscriptions.

Before you configure the application in the Engagement Server, you need to create the FCM key that needs to be associated with the client side application. Do refer the document below to create an FCM key. The FCM key is needed to send the push notifications to Android devices.
