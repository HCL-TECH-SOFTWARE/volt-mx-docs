=======================================

After you successfully complete the steps mentioned in the previous sections in this document, your Volt Foundry Setup is completed. And now you can run Volt Foundry Console. You can form URLs to access Volt Foundry Console.

> **_Note:_** To access Volt Foundry Console, at least you must install components such as console (accounts and workspace) and identity services.  
To create/register environments, install one or more runtime services such as integration services, and Engagement services.

The following are the sample URLs for Volt Foundry Components:

*   **Volt Foundry Console URL**: `<Protocol or http/https>://<Host or IP Address>:<Port>/mfconsole`
*   **Identity Services URL**:  `<Protocol or http/https>://<Host or IP Address>:<Port>/authService`  
*   **Integration Services URL**: `<Protocol or http/https>://<Host or IP Address>:<Port>/admin`
*   **Engagement Services URL**: `<Protocol or http/https>://<Host or IP Address>:<Port>/vpns`

You can now configure identity services and create an admin account for your Volt Foundry instance, and then access Volt Foundry Console.

Enter you details in the Volt Foundry login screen to login into Console. For more details, refer to [Accessing Volt Foundry Console - On-premises](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/How_to_access_VoltMX_Foundry_Portal_on-Prem.md#how-to-get-started-with-foundry-console).
