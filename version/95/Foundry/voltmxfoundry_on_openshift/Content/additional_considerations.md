## Encrypt the Database Password

> **Important:** Encryption is only supported for Tomcat application servers.

Volt MX Foundry provides a 256-bit AES/GCM/NoPadding encryption utility, which can be used to encrypt your database password. To encrypt your database password, follow these steps:

1.  After you download and extract the installation zip file, navigate to the `lib` folder.
2.  From the `lib` folder, open a terminal (console), and then execute the following command:

    ```
    java -jar EncryptionUtility.jar</code></pre>
    ```

3.  In the **Enter Password to be Encrypted** field, type the password that is used to access your database.
4.  In the **Enter Key to be Encrypted** field, type the key that must be used to encrypt the password.

The console then displays the **Encrypted Password** and **Encrypted Key**. These values must be added to the `DB_PASS`Â and `DB_PASS_SECRET_KEY` parameters in the `config.properties` file. For more information, refer to [Database Details](configuration_and_setup.html#Database).
