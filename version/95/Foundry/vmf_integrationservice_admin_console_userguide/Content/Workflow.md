Workflow Services
=================

It lists all the Workflow Services that were published to the current environment from Volt MX Foundry Console. You can view all the instances of the Workflow that were triggered from here and the run-time status of each triggered instance from here. To know more about Workflow service, refer [Workflow Service](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/Workflow.md).

Click the **Workflow Services** from the left pane of the App Services to view the list of Workflow services.

### How to Retry a Failed Task of a Workflow

> **_Note:_** For Event triggered workflows, the Retry functionality works the same as in the case of object triggered workflows.

When a task/node is failed, the workflow execution status goes to failed status. To view the actual error that has caused to failed the task, click the **Retry** icon next to the **FAILED** status of a service node/task.

Error details of each failed tasks are displayed in the **Admin Console > Retry Details** dialog box. These error details help you to troubleshoot the issue and then retry the task again. The **Retry Details** dialog box displays the workflow namespaces error data in six tabs, as follows:

You can fix a failed task in one of the following ways:


<details close markdown="block"><summary>How to Manual Retry with Edit Payload via Namespaces and Retry a Failed task (Fixing the data issue in Runtime and Retry a Failed Task)</summary>

While executing a workflow service, if there are any data errors, it will cause a task failure. So the related workflow instance goes into a failed state at the same time. You can address any data error issues by modifying the underlying workflow namespace data payloads in the **Retry Details** dialog box, and then retry the failed task again.

Use Case: An invalid email ID of a user is populated into the FOUNDRY\_WORKFLOW\_CONTEXT from a backend or a client request, and the same email ID is used in the **Email Task** to send email notifications to the user. Due to the invalid email ID, the **Email Task** node fails to send the mail to the user, and this causes the Workflow instance goes into failed state.  
[![](Resources/Images/SendTaskFailed_thumb_0_48.jpg)](Resources/Images/SendTaskFailed.jpg)

The following steps help you to fix this data error issue in the runtime and execute the workflow again:

1.  In the Admin Console > Workflow Services tab, navigate to the failed task of the your workflow instance.
2.  Click the **Retry** button.
    
    [![](Resources/Images/SendTaskFailed1_thumb_0_48.jpg)](Resources/Images/SendTaskFailed1.jpg)
    
3.  Under **Retry Details** dialog box that appears, do the following:
    1.  Click the **FOUNDRY\_WORKFLOW\_CONTEXT**Â tab. The error data of the **FOUNDRY\_WORKFLOW\_CONTEXT** namespace is displayed in a JSON format.  
        For example, here the emailID without a **@** symbol is came from the backend.  
        [![](Resources/Images/SendTaskFailed3_thumb_0_48.jpg)](Resources/Images/SendTaskFailed3.jpg)
        1.  Enter the correct email IDÂ of the user in the JSON payload.  
            You can validate the JSON payload by clicking the **Validate** button available in the JSON payload window. If the JSONÂ payload is invalid, the errors message is displayed with the link to download the error payload.  
            [![](Resources/Images/SendTaskFailed4_thumb_0_48.jpg)](Resources/Images/SendTaskFailed4.jpg)
        2.  Click **SAVE**.
    2.  Navigate to the **Failed Task** tab in the **Retry Details** dialog box.
        1.  Â Click the **Retry Task** button.
4.  Click **Refresh** in the workflow instances list page to get the latest data.
    
    After the service task is executed successfully, the status changes to `DONE - Manually Retried`.

<details close markdown="block"><summary>How to Retry a failed task manually (Fixing the issue in Design-time app and Retry a Failed Task)</summary>

In this case, the issue must be fixed in the Foundry app and republish the app to the runtime server. And then you must Retry the task to be executed again using the **Retry Details** dialog box in Admin Console.

Use Case: In this example, in the [**Loan\_Approval** sample application](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/Workflow_Implementation.md), due to a wrong back-end URL, the **Calculate Interest Rate** service task is failed. Here, the back-end server is unable to process the request. In the following sample screen shot, the back-end URL has missing of one `slash (/)`.

[![](Resources/Images/ServiceURLFail1_thumb_0_48.png)](Resources/Images/ServiceURLFail1.png)  

The following steps help you to fix this issue in Foundry app and execute the failed task again:

1.  Log into your Foundry Console, fix the back-end URLÂ issue in the required app, and then publish the app.
2.  In the Admin Console > Workflow Services tab, navigate to the failed task of the your workflow instance.
3.  Click the **Retry** icon.
    
    The **Retry Details** dialog box is displayed.
    

1.  Under **Failed Task** tab, click the **Retry Task** button.
    
    [![](Resources/Images/ServiceURLFail_thumb_0_48.png)](Resources/Images/ServiceURLFail.png)
    
2.  Click **Refresh** to get the latest data.
