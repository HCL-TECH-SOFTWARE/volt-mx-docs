Legacy Reports
--------------

The legacy reports tab will point to legacy data source and you can generate reports on them.

> **_Note:_** To access the legacy reports database, ensure that you have configured voltmxreports.home environment property points to a valid directory and a JNDI entry for voltmxadminreports.jndi.name exists to access the Legacy reports database. Legacy Reports is only needed if you have upgraded from a 5.x Volt MX Server instance and need to run reports on data captured before the 6.x upgrade.
