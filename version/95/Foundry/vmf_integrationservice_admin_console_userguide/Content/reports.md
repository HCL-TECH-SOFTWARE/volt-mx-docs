Reports
=======

As a part of App Services, a standard set of application metrics are gathered and made available to end users as reports. These reports are generated based on few parameters such as the application usage, service duration, number of requests received and legacy details such as traffic reports for service, for visitors and more.

You have two different types of reports such as Basic reports and Legacy reports.

**Basic Reports**: A basic report is generated to filter the data such as application usage, service duration, Requests per service and more. You can configure the data using the basic authentication to generate a basic report. For detailed information, refer [Basic Reports](Using_Basic_Reports.md#basic-reports).

**Legacy Reports**: To generate a legacy report you must configure the voltmxreports.home environment in your system. A legacy report can be generated to filter the traffic of various applications/platforms. For detailed information, refer [Legacy reports](Using_Legacy_Reports.md).

**Reports Settings**: Different types of report settings are displayed in the **Settings** page. Using the report settings you can modify the displays of the reports, change the timezone and modify the meta data mapping. For detailed information, refer [Reports Settings](Configuring_Report_Settings.md).
