Application Performance Monitoring
==================================

Application performance monitoring (APM) is the ability to check and track the performance of an application. APM is an ability to diagnose the issues to be able to maintain an expected level of performance for the application.

With availability of the out of the box Volt MX APM feature, Volt MX allows developers and business analysts to monitor the performance of the app and see the journey of various users using the app.

APM gives them the much needed insight into user behavior and the data to identify usage patterns. This allows the business to make data driven decisions for the app based on application usability and usage patterns.
