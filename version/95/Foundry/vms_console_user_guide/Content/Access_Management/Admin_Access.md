============

The **Admin Access** section includes **Members** and **Groups**. The access to **Members** and **Groups** module is privileged only to an administrator user.

The **Members** module deals with adding members, editing member's profiles, activate or deactivate members, and assigning, or unassigning groups to the members.

Groups are a set of similar users that provide a flexible way to define compound access rights as a whole. The Admin user manages different types of user groups within an organization. Groups are useful when you have two entities to work on a common issue. For example, a campaign manager and team members can handle a campaign issue collaboratively by creating a group.

> **_Important:_** As a user, you must have the following permissions to access the Admin Access home page and perform different tasks based on the role:
