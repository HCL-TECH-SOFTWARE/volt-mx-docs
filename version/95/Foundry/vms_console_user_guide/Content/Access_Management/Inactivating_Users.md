====================

Based on your requirement, you can inactivate a member. You cannot bind an inactivated member to directory as the authentication operation fails.

1.  To inactivate a member, under the **Status** column, select the check box next to the Member's name in the list view.
2.  Under the **Status** column, select the status as **Inactive**, from the drop-down list.
