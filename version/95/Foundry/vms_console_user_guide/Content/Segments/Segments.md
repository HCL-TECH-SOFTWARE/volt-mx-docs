========

A segment is obtained from different condition sets based on a user's attributes (First Name, Last Name, Email, Mobile Number, Country, State, Location, Beacon, Country, State, and any user defined attribute) and the OS of the device (Android or iOS). For example, the **Discount-Offers** **segment** includes users who live in the USA (user attribute – Country) and residents of California (user attribute – State). A segment is added in a campaign and used to send messages to users. For example, the **Discount-Offers campaign** includes the Discount-Offers segment to send discount offers to users from California State.
