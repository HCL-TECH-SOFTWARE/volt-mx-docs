    In the **Subscribers** list view, you can modify only the **Subscription Status** column as Active or Inactive to stop or resume push notifications to subscribers.When an _unsubscribe request_ is sent to Push Notification Services, the system sets the status in the **Cloud Status** column.
    
    The **Subscribers List** grid contains the following details:
    
    *   **Search All fields** **box**:Helps you to search all fields in the grid of the Subscribers List screen. You can also sort any column by using the search fields.
    *   **Reconciliation Key** - **Email**: This field displays the name of the reconciliation key that is set by Administrator.
        
        > **_Important:_** Reconciliation key is a must for audience members to get reconciled with the subscribers. It is a must for sending messages to audience members only. You must define reconciliation key in the Administration module of Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services.
        
    
    *   **Ksid**: The column displays Volt MX Subscription Identification serial numbers of the application. The KSID is used to communicate with Volt MX Foundry Engagement  Server.

When an application registers for push notifications, the device id of the mobile device is registered in the Push Notification Service (PNS).

        If any subscribers' status for Cloud or Subscription is Inactive, then those subscribers will not receive push messages.
