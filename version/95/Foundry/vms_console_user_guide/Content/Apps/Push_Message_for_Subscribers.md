    The **Define Message Target** **for Subscribers** grid contains the following details:
    
    *   Search All Fields: Helps you search all fields in the grid of the Define Message Target section. You can also sort any column by using the search fields. For more details how to search data in the Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services, see [Searching Data in Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services.](Searching_Data_in_VMS.md)
    *   Ksid: The column displays Volt MX Subscription Identification serial numbers of the application. The KSID is used to communicate with Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services Server. The KSID is generated by Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services based on the details you provided when you send request for subscription such as application id, device id, and SID.
    *   Reconciliation Key: This column displays reconciliation key values.
    *   Device Token: This column displays device IDs of registered devices. When an application registers for push notifications, the device id of the mobile device is registered in the Push Notification Service (PNS). When PNS wants to send a push message, the cloud uses the device token to locate the device on which the client application is installed, and then sends a push notification.
    *   Platform: This column displays a list of targeted platforms configured for the application.
