==============

Volt MX  Foundry Engagement Services allows you search data for all the girds quickly based on columns. Filtering data is a quick and easy way to find and work with a subset of data in the grid. For example, you can filter to see only the values that you specify.

To filter data for any column in the grid, follow these steps:

1.  Do one of the following:

*   To filter any data in the grid, enter your text in the **Search all fields** text box and then press **Enter**.
    
    > **_Note:_** When you use the **Search all fields** text box to search data, the system displays only the searched data in the grid. Based on the searched data, you can still sort the data by using individual filters provided under each column names in the grid.
    
    For example:
    
    | Before Search all fields filter | After Search all fields filter |
    | --- | --- |
    | ![](../Resources/Images/App/Search all fields.png) | ![](../Resources/Images/App/Search all fields after.png) |
    

*   To filter data based on a particular column in the grid , enter your text in the **Search** text box and then press **Enter**.
    
    | Before Search column filter | After Search column filter |
    | --- | --- |
    | ![](../Resources/Images/App/Search column.png) | ![](../Resources/Images/App/Search column after.png) |
    
    > **_Note:_** When you use the Search all fields text box to search filtered data, only the data that is displayed is searched. You can still sort that data.
    

*   To filter data based on the **Status** column or the **Targeted Platforms(s)** column, select one of the options that you want from the **All search** drop-down list.
    
      
    For example:
    
    | Before **All search** filter | After **All search** filter |
    | --- | --- |
    | ![](../Resources/Images/App/Status filter before.png) | ![](../Resources/Images/App/Status filtered.png) |
    
    > **_Note:_**  
    1\. When you use the Search all fields text box to search filtered data, only the data that is displayed is searched. You can still sort that data.  
      
    2\. The search or sort is a temporary condition that is only remains in effect for the duration of the current screen session, or until you:  
      
         -  Select another column to sort in the same grid  
      
          -  Click any other module in the console.
    
    > **_Note:_** Follow the same to search data for the rest of module in Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services such as Subscribers, Campaigns, Events, Audience Members, Segments, Users, and Groups.
