---------------------

In Volt MX Engagement services, applications are the primary elements that you add in the console, and enable them for push notifications. You can add apps based on operating system of your device such as Apple, Android, Windows, and Web.

To enable push notifications, you need to add a new application into Volt MX Engagement services and publish the application. Only published applications can be used to send push notifications to customers.

To add an application, follow these steps:

1.  In the **Applications** screen, click the **Add New App** button.
    
    The **Add New App** page appears with the two tabs, **App Info** and **Settings**. By default, the **App Info** tab is set to active.
    
2.  Enter details in the [App Info section](Adding_Basic.md).
3.  Enter details in the [Settings section](Platforms.md).
4.  Click **Cancel** if you do not want to add a new app.
5.  Click **Save** to continue.
    
    The newly added app appears on the **Apps** home page. The current status of the newly added app is unpublished.
    
6.  On app, in the upper right corner, click the drop-down list to select the option as publish to publish the app.
