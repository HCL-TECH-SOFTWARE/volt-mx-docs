=============

Push messages is one of the most important features of the Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services. It is a permission based value added way to deliver a message to application users at the specified time and location. Push messages are sent to only subscribed apps that are active and installed on mobile devices.

For more details about Volt MX notifications, refer to [Introduction](../Introduction.md).

The Push Messages feature allows you to configure and send push messages based on the preferences and personalization attributes for the targeted subscribers or segments.

You can do the following in Push Message view:

*   Push Message with option to tag personalization attributes.
*   Search option to select the specific set of segments as recipients.
*   Set and start expiry time.
*   Choose own personalized template for push message.

1.  In the **Applications** home screen **\>** **Application Name** **\>** click one of the applications link. The **View Applications** screen appears.
