==========

A geofence is based on a set of geographic coordinates, such as longitude, latitude, and radius. In a real-world scenario, a geofence uses geographic coordinates to determine a location, such as an area.  

For example, McDonald's wants to show all its branches in a city so that a user can search the nearest location to dine with friends or throw a party. You need to create geolocations in the Engagement server and invoke the **Fetch Nearest Location** API that returns the list of geo-boundaries based on the distance.

The **Geofencing** page displays the following details:
