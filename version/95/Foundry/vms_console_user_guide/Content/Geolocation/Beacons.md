=======

iBeacon is an indoor location technology that transmits signals and can be received by other devices using Bluetooth LE (low energy) technology. In a real-world scenario, iBeacon technology helps end users. For example, passengers at an airport can receive personalized alerts about when their electronic boarding passes are issued. Similarly, buyers at a store can automatically receive location-specific rewards, discounts, and product notifications when they enter the range of a beacon.Â Currently, the **Engagement** server supports ibeacons only.
