=========

Location functionality enables administrators to select a geographic point using latitude and longitude information and then create a virtual boundary around the point of a given radius. When a device enters or exits a Geo-Fence boarder set by administrator, a push notification is sent to that device. From the **Engagement** section, under **Location** you can add geolocations and configure them. Similarly, you can use REST APIs to add geolocations and configure them.

From the **Settings** section, click **API Help** from the left panel. The API Access page appears with sixteen tabs: **Subscription**,**Message**, **Locations**, **Campaigns**,**Segments**, **Users**, **Events**, **Templates**, **Configuration**, **Message Status**, **Access Management**, **Applications**, **Inbound SMS**, **Pass**, **Test Connection** and **Authentication**. By default, the **Subscription** tab is set to active.
