===============

A Name Value Pair is a simple way of data representation. It is a set of two linked data items: a name that is a unique identifier for some item of data, and the value that is either the data that is identified or a pointer to the location of that data.  
  
Volt MX  Foundry Engagement Services enables its users to reuse Name\_value pairs for event push messages for future extension without modifying existing code or data.  
You can specify name and value pair that describes the contents of entire event or of individual event. With these descriptors, you can construct filters for determining what packages to be delivered.  
While composing event messages, you can enable any text as _Name\_Value pair_ by using the **Mark as Name\_Value PAIR** button. The system displays the text as highlighted in the message box. Also the system loads it into the _Sample Request_Â  syntax block of the event Payload as tags with other tags. Users can send multiple event messages to different subscribers only by modifying values in the _Name\_Value pair_s.
