============

To configure your event message, you can use a pre-defined template or create a new push message for an event. You can do the following tasks from the **Add Event** > **Define Message** page:

*   [Adding a Push Message](#adding-a-push-message)
*   [Modifying a Push Message](Modifying_an_Event__Push_Message.md)
*   [Deleting a Push Message](Deleting_a_Event_Push_Message.md)

    The **Push Message** grid appears. The push message grid includes a push message label and the **Compose Message** button to compose push messages. If no push message is found, the system displays the message: **No message configured**.

    The **Compose Message** window includes the **Message Information** section to add a new push message. You can define a push message with the following options:
    
    *   [Silent Push](#silent-push)
    *   [Copy from Template](#copy-from-template)

    By default, the **Message Type** option is set to **Standard Push**.

        > **_Note:_** The standard push notifies the user when a device receives a push notification. The silent push does not notifies the end-user. When a silent push notification reaches a device, the app is awakened in the background and takes some time to download the new content.
        
        The Compose Message window displays applicable fields: **Message Name**, **Application Name**, and the **Platform-Specific Properties**.
