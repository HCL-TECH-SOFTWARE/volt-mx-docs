===============================

As an administrator, you can terminate a campaign. A terminated campaign cannot send any notifications. You can terminate a campaign manually before the set expiry date so that no notifications are sent for the campaign.

You can stop a campaign either from the Campaigns home page or from the View Campaign > Define Message page.
