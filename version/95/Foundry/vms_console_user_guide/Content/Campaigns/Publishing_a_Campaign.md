=====================

Only after publication a Campaign becomes available for push notifications. Unpublished campaigns are visible to Admin only. Once a campaign is created, it is displayed in the grid view with status as Unpublished. As a prerequisite, to make changes in the Status of a Campaign, you should own that campaign.

> **_Note:_** You can change a campaign's status either in the Campaigns home screen or while modifying a campaign.

To publish a Campaign, follow these steps:

1.  A newly created Campaign Status is **Unpublished**. Click the Status drop-down list to change the Status from Unpublished to **Published**.
    
    The **Campaign Approval Notification** appears informing that the Campaign is published successfully.
    
2.  Click **OK** to continue.
3.  The Status changes from Unpublished to Published.
    
    > **_Note:_** Based on your requirement, you can change the status from Published to Unpublished and vice versa.
    

##### Republishing the Modified Campaigns

If there are changes to the Campaign definition, you may require updating the published Campaigns. After updating a published Campaign, the status remains Published but a stale status icon next to the corresponding Campaign is used to indicate that changes have been made to the definition of the Campaign. To validate the carried out updates, you need to republish the Campaign.

The status must be changed to published again for the changes to take effect. Campaign owner and all related users to the campaign receive notification to review and update the changes.

> **_Note:_** You can republish a campaign either in the Campaigns home screen or from View Campaign screen.
