=================

To save a campaign, follow these steps:

1.  In the **Add Campaign** screen, click the **Save Campaign** button.
    
    The **Add Campaign** window closes automatically and then the new campaign is added in the list view. System displays the confirmation message that campaign is saved successfully.
    
    > **_Note:_** A campaign is not ready to be used, if a user only fills basic details (and does not select segments details or composes a campaign message) and still clicks Save Campaign.
    
    > **_Note:_** If a campaign is in draft mode, then the **Execute Campaign** and the **Terminate Campaign** buttons remains disabled.
