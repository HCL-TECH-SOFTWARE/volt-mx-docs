=======================

As an administrator, you can delete any push message as required.

To delete a push message, follow these steps:

1.  Select the **Delete** icon next to the message name.

2.  The **Confirm Delete** alert message appears asking if you want to delete both the first message and the repeat message.
3.  Click **Cancel**. The confirm delete dialog closes without deleting any push message.
4.  Click **Ok** to continue.
    
    The push message is removed from the list-view.
    
    > **_Important:_** If you delete the first message, the first message and the repeat message are deleted. If you delete the repeat message, only the repeat message is deleted.
