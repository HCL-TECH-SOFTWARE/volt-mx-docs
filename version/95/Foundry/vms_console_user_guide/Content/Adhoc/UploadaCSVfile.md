---------------------

If you select the user option as **Upload a CSV file**, the **User Information** page displays the **Device Attribute** drop-down list and **Upload File** option, and **Choose File** to select the file from your system. By default, the **Device Attribute** list is set to **KSID**.

The **Upload User CSV** option allows you to select bulk audience at a time. The `CSV` file needs to have a single column of entries of the attribute. Each entry should be in a new line with no space in between.
