======================================

An administrator can subscribe or unsubscribe a specific notification channel for a user. When a user is unsubscribed for a channel, the user does not receive messages from that channel.  
You can also subscribe or unsubscribe a channel through **Audience** API. The **Audience** API helps you pull user information and present it on the app, and gives an option to update the data.

**To unsubscribe a channel, follow these steps**:

1.  Navigate to the **Users** list view. Under the **Subscribed Channels** column:
    
    *   Click the text dialog icon to unsubscribe SMS.
    *   Click the envelope icon to unsubscribe emails
    
    The **Unsubscribe** link appears.
