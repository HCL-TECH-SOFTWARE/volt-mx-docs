=======================================================

As an administrator, you can activate or inactivate a subscription from a device. Only active subscriptions are eligible to send push notifications. To stop sending notifications from a device, you need to inactivate that subscription.

The **Engagement** server displays an error message if you try to select a combination of active and inactive devices to perform the activate or inactivate action.

> **_Note:_** You can activate or inactivate a subscription from the **Devices** home page or from the **Device Details** page.

> **_Important:_** Both the **Subscribing** and **Activating** are the same actions. Equally **Unsubscribing** and **Inactivating** are the same actions.  
In the **Apps** list view, under the **Apps** column, hover your mouse over the green icon to view the **Subscribe/Unsubscribe** option.  
You can use the **Inactivate** button available at the bottom of the **Apps** list view to inactivate a subscriber.

Inactivating a Subscription Through a User Interference
-------------------------------------------------------

A user can inactivate a subscription to disable it temporarily. To inactivate, you need to run the **Unsubscribe** API to inactivate a subscription using **KSID** as an input parameter. Once a subscription is removed, a red icon appears next to the app details under the **Installed Apps** column. The red icon indicates that the subscription is forcibly unsubscribed manually on user's request and cannot receive any push notifications or, a user has not installed the app.
