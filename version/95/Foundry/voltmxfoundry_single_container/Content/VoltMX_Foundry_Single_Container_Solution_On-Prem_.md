Overview - Volt Foundry Single Container Solution
===================================================

The Volt Foundry Single Container On-Premises solution offers a quick way to set up Volt Foundry on your local environment. It leverages the following technology:

*   **Docker** - To package different components as portable container images (with all the required binaries and libs).

Salient Features
----------------

The Volt Foundry Single Container Solution provides developers with tools to build applications.

The Volt Foundry Single Container Solution has the following features:

*   Deploys Volt Foundry on a native Docker container.
*   Supports multi-platform deployment in Windows, Linux, and macOS.
*   Deploys MySQL container along with Foundry for developer use.

Prerequisites
-------------

*   Install `Docker Engine version 26.0.0` and `Docker Compose version 2.24.6`.
    
    > **Note:** For Windows and macOS, you can download and install the package installer for `Docker Desktop version 4.28.0 (139021)`. For Linux, you must install Docker Engine and Docker Compose separately.  
        
*   On Windows machines, use any bash/shell prompt to execute the install-foundry.sh script. macOS and Linux support Bash prompt by default. install-foundry.sh is located in `VoltFoundrySingleContainer-<version>_GA.zip`, which you will download to start the installation. See <a href="#installation">Installation</a> for details.
*   Install Java 11.
*   Install an external Database. (The supported types are mentioned [here](#supported-databases).)

    > **Note:** The Single Container Solution comes with built-in MySQL, which will deploy alongside the Volt Foundry container. This can be used for developer use. Please refer to the Configuration section for more details. For other supported databases, Volt Foundry requires an existing external database.

> **Note:**

>   *   To execute the installation scripts, you must use **Bash version 4** or later.  
>   *   To avoid an unknown host exception, make sure that the IP address is configured with the hostname. To do so, follow the steps that are mentioned in the [FAQs section](#faqs-and-troubleshooting).

Architecture
------------

For flyway migrations, a container with database image (voltmx-foundry-db) is created. The database image is terminated after all the migrations are completed.

After the migrations are completed, the second container will run the Volt Foundry Docker single image (voltmx-foundry-all). This container keeps running in the background for as long as the Volt Foundry setup is required.

Following are the two containers present in the Volt Foundry Single Container Solution:

*   Volt Foundry
*   Database (exists on completion of the Database scripts execution)

The following is the list of Docker images used in the Volt Foundry Single Container Solution:

*   Foundry (contains `mfconsole.war`,   `workspace.war`, `accounts.war`, `apiportal.war`, `authService.war`, `admin.war`, `services.war`, `middleware.war`, `apps.war`, and `vpns.war`)
*   Database (contains database migration scripts)


The docker images will be pulled when you execute the installation scripts in the "HCL Volt Foundry Container Installer" found on HCL's FNO download website. To download "HCL Volt Foundry Single Container Installer (Docker)", log on to "https://hclsoftware.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operationsportal/entitledDownloadFile.action?downloadPkgId=HCL_Volt_Foundry_v9.5_Latest&orgId=HCL.

Limitations
-----------

Volt Foundry Single Container Solution has the following limitations:

*   Support for **SPA / Desktop Web** is only available for zipped SPA apps, but not for WARs.
*   **Log Analytics** is currently not supported.

FAQs and Troubleshooting
------------------------

*   **Do I need to have an account with the HCL Harbor to pull the Volt Foundry Images?**
    
    No. The images are public, and you do not need any authorization to download them.
    
*   **How should I restart a container that has been killed?**
    
    To restart a container you must do the following:
    
    *   Go to Downloads (the folder you downloaded and extracted it to) > `VoltMXFoundrySingleContainer-9.x.x.x-GA/foundry-<NUMBER>/` folder. &lt;NUMBER&gt; is a random number generated during installation.
	
    *   Run the command: `docker-compose up -d`.
    
*   **How to configure the IP address as the hostname to avoid an unknown host exception?**
    
    1. Update the hostname and IP in the hosts file.

      *   For **Linux**: `“/etc/hosts”`
      *   For **Windows 10 and 8**: `“c:\Windows\System32\Drivers\etc\hosts”`
      *   For **macOS**: `/private/etc/hosts`
      *   Once the file is updated with <IP> SPACE <HOSTNAME>, save and close the file.
        
          > **_Note:_** In case you still face an issue with the hostname resolution, you must flush the DNS cache.
        
    2.  Update `docker-compose.yml` file under `Downloads/VoltMXFoundrySingleContainer-9.x.x.x-GA/foundry/`
	
        *   Add a section under restart key in the following order:
        
            ```
            extra_hosts:  
            - "<HOSTNAME>:<IP>"
			```
        
        Once updated, the file will look like the following image: 
        
    <br/>
    
    ![](Resources/Images/FAQ3.png)
    

Extracting Logs from your Application
-------------------------------------

To perform any actions related to the logs of your application, you need the names or IDs of the containers in the application.

At a bash or CMD prompt, run "docker ps" to get the list of currently running containers. You can then use `docker logs -f <CONTAINER ID>` or `docker logs -f <CONTAINER_NAME>` to get the logs of the desired pod. Please refer to the official <a href="https://docs.docker.com/reference/cli/docker/container/logs/" target="_blank">Docker</a> documentation for more logging options for the container.

If you want to **teletype (tty)** into the container, execute one of the following commands from your terminal:

*   For **Windows**: `winpty docker exec -it <container_name> bash` or `winpty docker exec -it <container_id> bash`
*   For **macOS/Linux**: `docker exec -it <container_name> bash` or `docker exec -it <container_id> bash`

> **_Note:_** A database container terminates after the flyway migrations are complete. As a result, you cannot tty into the database container post installation.

If you want to **copy logs** (for example: Component logs) from the Foundry container to your local machine, execute one of the following commands from your terminal:

`docker cp <container_name>:<location_in_container> <location_in_machine>`

`docker cp <container_id>:<location_in_container> <location_in_machine>`

For example, to copy **authService logs**, execute the following command from your terminal:

`docker cp foundry_tomcat_1:/usr/local/logs/authService.log /d/Foundry/logs`

> **_Note:_** Component logs can be found at `/usr/local/logs` inside the container.

Configuring Iris to connect to Volt Foundry
