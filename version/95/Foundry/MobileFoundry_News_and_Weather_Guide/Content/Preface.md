=======

VoltMX Foundry is a Mobile Back-end as a Service (MBaaS) provider that helps developers build native and web apps for mobile. Various back-end services are easily integrated with the application irrespective of whether the application is built using JavaScript, PhoneGap, iOS, or Android frameworks.

VoltMX Foundry allows you to define the back-end to build native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and HTML5-based apps for modern browsers. VoltMX Foundry ensures that developers build mobile applications quickly by focusing on core areas and obtaining secured back-end services instantly. VoltMX Foundry has multiple features that can be used - Identity, Integration, Orchestration, Objects, Sync, and Engagement Services. These features can be accessed through a common, centralized console.
