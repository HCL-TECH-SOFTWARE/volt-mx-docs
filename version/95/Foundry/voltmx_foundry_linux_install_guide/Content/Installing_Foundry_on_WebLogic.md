Introduction
------------

This installer will install a new or upgrade an existing instance of Foundry.

Volt Foundry is a set of enterprise-grade mobile infrastructure services that
makes it easy to build amazing apps that integrate and support all of your
backend systems. With open, standards-based development, scalable and secure
services, and exceptional agility, enterprises can dramatically reduce the
cost and complexity of enterprise mobility projects.

To proceed with installation, please confirm that the following prerequisites
have been met -

1. Database server with admin user for installation. MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle
and MS SQL Server are the supported Database servers. MariaDB is supported for
Tomcat/JBoss only
2. Corresponding database user should exist and that user should have all
required privileges as per the documentation.
3. If you want to use your existing SSL certificate then please have the SSL
certificate mapped to the domain name you want to use.
4. If you want to install with JBoss as an option for application server, then
have the application server preconfigured. Please note that single node JBoss
is also bundled as part of the installer, in case you want to install afresh.

To change input, type 'back' to go back to the previous step.
To cancel the installation, type 'quit' at any time.

PRESS &lt;ENTER&gt; TO CONTINUE:

their user ID when authenticating
within the application or by a unique device identifier when using the
application without authenticating.
Multiple devices used under the same authenticated user ID count as one User.

number of computers or
servers and each Unique User may have simultaneous access to any number of
instances of the Program
at one time. Licensee must obtain separate, dedicated entitlements for each
Unique User given access to
the Program in any manner directly or indirectly (for example: via a

User and may not be shared, nor may it be reassigned other than for the
permanent transfer of the Unique
User entitlement to another person or entity.

Named User
Named User is defined as an employee, contractor, or outsource provider under

PRESS &lt;ENTER&gt; TO CONTINUE:

the employment (direct
or contractually) of the Customer or Customer's member organizations with a

customers not supported
by the B2E use case. Each use case licensed by Customer, supported by a hosted
cloud environment,
will require a separate cloud instance for each use case. The maximum number

PRESS &lt;ENTER&gt; TO CONTINUE:

of apps that can be
hosted on any one cloud instance is twenty.

Session
Session is defined as user interaction with an application either as an
interactive session or triggered
application logic executed in the background as a non-interactive session. The
Session begins when the
app is started. It is continued until the app is idle for thirty (30) minutes
or until the user ends the app
process or operating system explicitly closing the app. The maximum duration
for a session is four (4)
hours. If an app session continues for four (4) hours, a new session is
automatically created.

To use Volt Foundry with WebLogic Server in combination with MySQL database,
place the MySQL connector jar (mysql-connector-java-8.x.x.jar) in the
WebLogic Server.

Perform the following steps to complete pre-requisites before continuing with
installation :-

1. Copy the mysql-connector-java-8.x.x.jar from your Volt Foundry
Installation folder - /home/foundry/VoltFoundryInstaller-GA-9.5.15.0
location.
2. Paste the mysql-connector-java-8.x.x.jar into the &lt;WL_HOME&gt;/server/lib
folder
3. Go to the &lt;WL_HOME&gt;/user_projects/domains/base_domain/bin and edit the
startWeblogic script file.
- For Windows: startWeblogic.cmd
- For Linux: startWeblogic.sh
4. Prepend your JAR file to the SAVE_CLASSPATH environment variable.
For Example
        Windows: set SAVE_CLASSPATH=%WL_HOME%/server/lib/mysql-connector-java-8.x.x.
jar;%CLASSPATH%
        Linux: SAVE_CLASSPATH="${WL_HOME}/server/lib/mysql-connector-java-8.x.x.
jar:${CLASSPATH}"
5. Restart the server.

Please read before continuing:

To use Volt Foundry with WebLogic Server in combination with Oracle database,
place the Oracle connector jar (ojdbc11.jar) in the WebLogic Server.

Perform the following steps to complete pre-requisites before continuing with
installation :-

1. Copy the ojdbc11.jar from your Volt Foundry Installation folder -
/home/foundry/VoltFoundryInstaller-GA-9.5.15.0 location.
2. Paste the ojdbc11.jar into the &lt;WL_HOME&gt;/server/lib folder
3. Go to the &lt;WL_HOME&gt;/user_projects/domains/base_domain/bin and edit the
startWeblogic script file.
- For Windows: startWeblogic.cmd
- For Linux: startWeblogic.sh
4. Prepend your JAR file to the SAVE_CLASSPATH environment variable.
For Example
Windows: set SAVE_CLASSPATH=%WL_HOME%/server/lib/ojdbc11.jar;%CLASSPATH%
Linux: SAVE_CLASSPATH="${WL_HOME}/server/lib/ojdbc11.jar:${CLASSPATH}"
5. Restart the server.

Note: &lt;WL_HOME&gt; is the folder where WebLogic is installed.
