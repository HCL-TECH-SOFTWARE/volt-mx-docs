### Proxy Settings for Integration Service

To add an Integration Service Environment when the proxy is set at an App Server level, enable the following proxy settings at the **JVM** level:

*   Dvoltmx.http.proxyHost= 10.0.4.29
*   Dvoltmx.http.proxyPort= 2080
*   Dvoltmx.http.proxyUser= websphere
*   Dvoltmx.http.proxyPassword= 3MqGU9e5nv3B

### Network Settings - Licensing              

The on-premises server should allow outbound requests to [https://manage.hclvoltmx.com](https://manage.hclvoltmx.com/) and allow inbound requests from our License servers (IPs, mentioned at the end, can be whitelisted in a customer’s firewall).

An on-premises Foundry 'development' or 'non-production' license can be activated without making the on-premises Identity URL available to our License servers. However, a 'production' license requires the Identity URL to be available to our License servers at the time of activation and thereafter as the license is validated on a weekly frequency. Each time that a production license is validated, the license validity is good for 30 days from the last successful validation. The Identity URL is expected to remain available to our License server for the entirety of their licensing term.

The Foundry Identity account tenant must be accessible on the internet. The Cloud license activation screen displays the Identity tenant configured in on-premise console. (For example, https:voltmxfoundry.mycompany.com/authService)

Cloud license activation flow appends “/accounts” to the Identity URL. (For example, https:voltmxmobilefoundry.mycompany.com/authService**/accounts**). The URL must be accessible on the public internet for license activation to work. The response of the URL should be “Welcome to Test Auth Service”.

Communication from HCL' License servers will originate from the following IP addresses, which can be whitelisted in an organization's firewall configuration:

*   54.208.192.84
*   54.208.192.248

Creating the Installation User for Linux
----------------------------------------

To create a user, follow these steps:

1.  From your Volt MX Foundry install system, open Linux terminal.
    
    > **_Note:_** For security and administrative reasons, install and run Volt MX Foundry Installer as a non-root user.
    
2.  Run the following commands:
    
    `\# adduser core`  
      
    `\# passwd core`
