 

Overview
========

Widgets are visual components that enhance development of mobile applications through minimal coding effort. When the widgets are combined with an application, the widgets hold all the applications data and the available interactions with this data.

Widgets often take the form of on-screen tools. The developers use different implementations of the widgets available in the _Integrated Development Environment (IDE)_ to build _Graphical User Interfaces (GUI)_. All the widgets described in this document are drag-and-drop widgets

All the VoltMX supported devices, development languages, and browsers are listed at, [Supported Devices and Browsers.](http://developer.voltmx.com/twiki/pub/Portal/Docs/VoltMXPlatform_List of Supported Devices_OS_Browsers.pdf)
