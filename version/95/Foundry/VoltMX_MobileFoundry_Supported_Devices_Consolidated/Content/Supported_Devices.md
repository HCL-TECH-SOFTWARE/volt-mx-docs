\* Above is a representative list but, in general VoltMX Studio supports BlackBerry OS 5.x to OS 10x.

\* Given the market share of the BlackBerry 5.x devices is nearly 95 percent, VoltMX recommends 5.x and above devices for good user experience. The support for devices less than 5.x is incidental.

\* On IDE, VoltMX continues to support for 4.5.x and 4.6.x for backward compatibility.

New features that are added in VoltMX Studio 5.5 onwards are not supported on BlackBerry/Platform.

Features for Windows Phone

Microsoft Windows 8 has three major versions. VoltMX supports both Lua and JavaScript as development languages to create native apps for all the versions of Windows 8.

The following Microsoft Windows 8 platforms are supported:

*   Microsoft Windows 8 on Intel chipset (desktop machines, Intel-based surface tablets).  
    *   To build native apps for these machines using VoltMX, do it either from Windows 7 desktop or Windows 8 desktop OS.
*   Microsoft Windows 8 on ARM chipset (MS Surface RT, Ultrabooks)  
    *   To build native apps for these machines using VoltMX, you must have VoltMX Studio on Windows 8 desktop OS.
*   Microsoft Windows 8 on x64 (MS Surface Pro, Mac, parallels with Windows 8)  
    *   To build native apps for these machines using VoltMX, you can do it either from Windows 7 desktop or Windows 8 desktop OS.
        

For Windows Phone 8 native apps: VoltMX supports both Lua and JavaScript. The Hybrid and Mixed modes are not supported.

VoltMX platform supports only Silverlight-based apps for Windows Phone 8.1.

For Windows Phone 7.5 (also known as Mango): VoltMX supports both Lua and JavaScript. The Hybrid and Mixed modes are not supported. Microsoft also released Windows Phone 7.8 for Mango devices only.
