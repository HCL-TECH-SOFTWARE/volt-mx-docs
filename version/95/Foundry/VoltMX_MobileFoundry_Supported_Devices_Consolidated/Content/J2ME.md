\* Above is a representative list but in general the VoltMX Studio supports BlackBerry OS 5.x to 7.x

\* Given the market share of the BlackBerry 5.x devices is nearly 95%, VoltMX recommends 5.x and above devices for good user experience. The support for devices less than 5.x is purely incidental.

\* On IDE we continue support for 4.5.x and 4.6.x for backward compatibility.

Windows 8 features

Microsoft Windows 8 has 3 major flavors. VoltMX supports both Lua and JS as development languages to create native apps for all the flavors of windows 8.

The following Microsoft Windows 8 platforms are supported:

*   Microsoft Windows 8 on Intel chipset (desktop machines, Intel based surface tablets).  
      
    *   If you want to build native apps for these machines using VoltMX, you can do it either from windows 7 desktop or windows 8 desktop OS.
*   Microsoft Windows 8 on ARM chipset ( MS Surface RT, Ultrabooks)  
      
    *   If you want to build native apps for these machines using VoltMX you must have VoltMX studio on windows 8 desktop OS.
*   Microsoft Windows 8 on x64 ( MS Surface Pro, Mac, parallels with Windows 8)  
      
    *   If you want to build native apps for these machines using VoltMX you can do it either from windows 7 desktop or windows 8 desktop OS.
        

For Windows Phone 8 native apps: We support both Lua and JS. The Hybrid and Mixed modes are not supported.

For Windows phone 7.5 (a.k.a Mango): We support both Lua and JS. The Hybrid and Mixed modes are not supported.

Microsoft has also released a new version, Windows phone 7.8, and this version release is only for Mango devices. This version does not have any new features except the start screen change. Microsoft wants to have a consistent look for the start screen across Windows phones.

Going forward there will be only two versions of Windows Phone:

*   Windows phone 8 and above for High end phones (HTC 8x, Lumia 920 etc.)
*   Windows phone 7.8 for Mid-range phones (Lumia 800, Samsung Focus etc.)
