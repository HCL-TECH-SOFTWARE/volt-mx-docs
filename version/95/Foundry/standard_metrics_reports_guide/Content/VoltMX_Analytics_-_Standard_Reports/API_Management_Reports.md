API Management Reports
======================

Volt MX  Foundry APIs such as Integration, Orchestration, and Object Services can be invoked from a client app by using Volt MX Foundry SDK APIs. You can also invoke Volt MX Foundry APIs through HTTP calls to the service URL such as in the case of API management.

The data sent from the Direct API calls through API Management is also captured from V8 SP3 onwards. The API Management reports fetch data for both Direct API calls and Volt MX SDKs calls.
