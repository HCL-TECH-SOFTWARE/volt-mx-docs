5.  Click **Parameter Mapping** icon to open parameter mapping dialog.

![](Resources/Images/customdashboards/Input_control_Parameter_Mapping_29.png)

In the above image, you can find all the input controls are mapped only to Active users report.

8.  To map the same input controls to New users report, click **+** on each of the input control and select the dashlet (New Users) and parameter combination.

![](Resources/Images/customdashboards/Input_control_Parameter_Mapping_30.png)

> **_Note:_** **User Types** input control of Active users cannot be mapped to New users report because New Users report do not have the same input control name.

11.  Click **OK** to apply the changes.
12.  Click **Preview** icon to run the dashboard.
13.  Select the input controls and click **Apply** to refresh both the charts.
    
    Both the charts are refreshed because input controls are mapped to both the charts.
    
14.  You can change only the user types input control and click **Apply** to refresh the active users report.

![](Resources/Images/customdashboards/Input_control_Parameter_Mapping_31_601x305.png)  

Similarly, you can map the custom reports which has common input controls.
