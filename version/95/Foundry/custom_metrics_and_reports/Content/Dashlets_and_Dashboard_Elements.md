-------------------------------

Each element on your dashboard is called a Dashlet. Dashlets have unique names, resource IDs and editable properties that vary depending on dashlet type. The permissions to access the repository may limit the content you can add and the location where you can save the dashboard.

To add a dashlet to your dashboard, follow these steps:

1.  Log on to **VoltMX Foundry Console** and click **Reports** from the left pane of the screen.
2.  Click **Custom Dashboards** tab from upper right corner of the **Reports** window.
    
    The **Custom Dashboards** window appears.
    
3.  Click **Create Dashboard** to create a new dashboard.
    
    The **Dashboard Designer** window appears.
    
4.  Drag a content element from **Available Content** pane to the **Dashboard Canvas**.
