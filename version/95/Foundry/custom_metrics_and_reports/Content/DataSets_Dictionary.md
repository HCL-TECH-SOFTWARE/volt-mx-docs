===================

There are two types of datasets. Datasets starting with the word Standard contains metrics collected for all applications deployed to development environments in the Cloud/VoltMX Foundry account. The Standard datasets are available even if no custom metrics have been defined.

Standard Metrics V8.0 is the latest Standard dataset. Standard Metrics V7.2, Standard Metrics and Events, and Standard Metrics are older versions of datasets and subsets of the Standard Metrics V8.0. For Cloud/On-premises, it is recommended to use Standard Metrics V8.0 dataset.
