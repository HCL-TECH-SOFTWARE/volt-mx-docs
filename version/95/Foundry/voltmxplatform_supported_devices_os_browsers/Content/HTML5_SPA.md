Disclaimers:

1.  Support for JavaScript on devices is directly dependent on the JavaScript engines embedded with the browsers.
2.  Volt MX Iris supports CSS3. Depending on the browser implementations, the rendering of the CSS may differ from browser to browser within the same family.
3.  Volt MX Iris uses the standards compliant GeoLocation API. Support for GPS depends on the GeoLocation API implemented by the browsers.
4.  Volt MX Iris is dependent on Google Maps to provide static and interactive maps. Apps using Google Maps should comply with the licensing requirements of Google.
5.  Only WebKit-based browsers are supported for the server-side mobile web and SPA HTML5 category. Because Firefox and Opera are not WebKit-based, they are not supported by SPA but are supported by Desktop Web.
