Installation Guide for Volt MX Foundry Containers Helm Installation
=====================================================================

Volt MX  Foundry is a back-end service provider that helps developers build omni-channel digital applications. Volt MX Foundry allows you to define the back-end to build native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and Windows and also SPAs and Responsive web apps for browsers. Volt MX Foundry ensures that developers build mobile applications quickly and obtain secured back-end services instantly. Volt MX Foundry has multiple features, such as - Identity, Integration, Objects, Orchestration, and Engagement Services. These features can be accessed through a common, centralized Volt MX Foundry Console.

This document helps you install and configure Volt MX Foundry (Console, Identity Services, Integration Services, and Engagement Services) using a Helm chart.  This is a new option in release 9.5 for installing Foundry to an existing Kubernetes cluster.  If you don't have an existing cluster to install into, you may want to review the traditional [Container Solution](../../voltmxfoundry_containers_solution_on-prem/Content/VoltMX_Foundry_Containers_Solution_On-Prem.md) which will create a new Kubernetes Cluster and then install Foundry with shell scripts and templates.
