Installing Hotfix Archives for Volt Foundry - Windows
=======================================================


The Volt Foundry Patch Installer can be used to apply patches (software updates) to Volt Foundry components for a specific GA release.

<b>For example:</b>

To apply a `9.5.x` patch to a version earlier than `9.5.x GA`, you need to upgrade to  9.5.x GA  by using the installer, and then apply the `9.5.x` patch.

The Patch Installer uses hotfix archives and applies the software updates to an existing Volt Foundry Installation. A hotfix archive (which is a `.zip` file) can have artifacts for one or more components. While installing hotfix archives, all components in the archive are installed to your existing Volt Foundry installation.

### Prerequisites

* Ensure that you have a previous version of Volt Foundry GA installed on your system at an accessible network location.

> **_IMPORTANT:_** If you are required to install hotfix archives to a set of components for a specific release, you must have the supported Volt Foundry GA version (for example, Volt Foundry 9.5.x) with required components installed on your system.<br>
<b>For example</b>, if you are required to install hotfix archive for Console version V 9.5.x, you must have Foundry 9.5.x GA with Console installed on your system.</br>


* Ensure that  `VoltFoundryPatchInstaller-9.5.x.QA.exe`  file has execute permission

* Please stop the windows Foundry service before applying the patch.
