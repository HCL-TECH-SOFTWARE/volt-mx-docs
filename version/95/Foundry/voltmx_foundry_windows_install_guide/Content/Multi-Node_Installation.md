                         


Installing Volt MX Foundry on a Domain Mode (Multi node installation in pre-configured JBoss cluster)
====================================================================================================

This section of the document provides you with the instructions for installing and configuring the Volt MX Foundry components on multinode.

> **_Important:_** Ensure that you have the required hardware and access to the supporting software as mentioned in the [Prerequisites](Prerequisites.md) section and performed the steps as mentioned in the [Pre-Installation Tasks](Pre-installation_Tasks.md) section.

> **_Important:_** Before installing Volt MX Foundry on domain mode, ensure that the JBoss cluster is configured on your install system.

To install the Volt MX Foundry console using the installer, follow these steps:

1.  Unzip the `VoltMXFoundrySetup.zip` file.
2.  Double-click `VoltMXFoundryInstaller-x.x.x.x.GA.exe` to launch the installer.  
    The **InstallAnywhere** dialog appears. The **InstallAnyWhere** dialog displays information about the progress of the software installation at run time.

    A dialog with the Volt MX logo appears.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/Install11_592x346.png)
    
3.  The **Welcome To Volt MX Foundry** windows appears.  
    Read the instructions carefully before installing Volt MX Foundry Console.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/Install2_583x422.png)
    
4.  Read the instructions carefully, and click **Next**.  
    The **LICENSE AGREEMENT** window appears.
    
5.  Scroll down and select the "**I accept the terms of the License Agreement**" option.
    
    > **_Note:_** To activate the License Agreement option, read carefully the entire text.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/Install4_583x422.png)  
    
6.  Click **Next**. The **Install Components** window appears with the following supported installation types:
    
    *   **Development** for single machine instance.
    *   **Non-Production** for larger environments like QA or UAT.
        
    *   **Production** for the production instance.
    
    Installation environment is set to Development by default .
    
    ![](Resources/Images/MF_InstallType_572x466.png)
    
7.  Choose one of the appropriate install type based on your license - for example, Development, Non-Production, or Production.
8.  Select the **Send usage data anonymously** check box. Allows HCL to collect product usage information to make your Volt MX Foundry experience better. HCL does not save any of your private or application data. By default this check box is selected.
9.  Click **Next**. The ****Choose components to install**** window appears.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/Choose_Component_601x459.png)
    
10. Select one or more check boxes for the supported components. By default, the **Console**, **Identity Services**, **Integration Services**, and **Engagement Services** check boxes are selected.
    
    *   **Console** - To install Volt MX Foundry Console, select the **Console** check box.  
        The system creates the following databases: `<prefix>mfconsoledb<suffix>`, `<prefix>mfaccountsdb<suffix>`, and  `<prefix>mfreportsdb<suffix>`.
    *   **Identity Services** - To install Volt MX Identity Services, select the **Identity Services** check box.  
        The system creates the following database: `<prefix>idconfigdb<suffix>`.
    *   **Integration Services** - To install Volt MX Foundry Integration Services, select the **Integration Services** check box.  
        The system creates the following databases: `voltmxadmindb`  and  `mfreportsdb`.
    *   **API Developer Portal** - To install developer portal, select the **API Developer Portal** check box.  
        
        > **_Note:_** During installation if you have selected **API Developer Portal**, the **API Developer Portal** is created. You can directly access your [VoltMX Developer Portal](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/VoltMXDevPortal.md) in Volt MX Foundry Console.
        
    *   **Engagement Services** - To install Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services, select the **Engagement Services** check box.  
        The system creates the following database: `<prefix>vpnsdb<suffix>`.
    
    **Reports Database**
    
    The reports database is used for configuring reports.
    
    The Installer creates the `mfreportsdb` if you choose either Console or Integration Services:
    
    *   **Console** without Integration Services (with or without Engagement Services)
    *   **Console** and **Integration Services** (with or without Engagement Services)
    *   **Integration Services** without Console (with or without Engagement Services)
    
    Reports Database for Integration on a Separate Node:
    
    While installing console and integration on separate nodes, the installer prompts you to point the reports database during the integration installation.  
      
    For example:  
      
    You have installed only Console on one node. The installer creates these three databases such as `<>mfreportsdb<>` along with the `<>mfconsoledb<>` and `<>mfaccountsdb<>`. For example, your report database name is `voltmxmfreportsdb1`  
      
    When you install the integration with or without one or more components (identity, or Engagement Services) on a separate node, the installer displays the **Reports Database Name** field in the **Database Details** window. If the installer prompts you to enter the existing reports db, enter the reports database name (for example, `voltmxmfreportsdb1`) in the **Database Details window > Reports Database Name** field. Refer to the [Database Details](#DatabaseDetails) window.  
      
    Refer to [creating a reports database, for example, **<prefix>mfreports<suffix>**](#CreatingReportsDB).
    
11. Click **Next**. The **Install Folder** window appears. The selected path appears in the **Where would you like to install** field.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/Install5_583x422.png)
    
12. Click **Choose** to browse the required folder from your system.
13. Click **Next**. The **Application Server** window appears asking you to choose the application server. By default, the Application Sever is set to Tomcat.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/JBoss_1.PNG)
    
14. In the **Application Server** window, click **JBoss**, and then click **Next**.
15. The **Installation Mode** window appears asking you to choose the mode. By default, this option is set to **Standalone Mode**. Click **Domain Mode (Multinode)**, and then click **Next**.
