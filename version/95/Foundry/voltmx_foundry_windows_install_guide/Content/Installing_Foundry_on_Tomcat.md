                         


Installing Volt MX Foundry on Tomcat
===================================

This section of the document provides you with the instructions for installing and configuring Volt MX Foundry components on a single node. For multi-node installations, refer to [Deployment Checklist and Example Case Studies](../../../Foundry/voltmx_Foundry_deployment_guide/Content/Deployment_Checklist.md).

> **_Important:_** You need the required hardware and access to the supporting software as mentioned in the [Prerequisites](Prerequisites.md) section and must perform the steps noted in the [Pre-installation Tasks](Pre-installation_Tasks.md) section.

Make sure that you have proper administrative rights to install Volt MX Foundry on your computer.

The **\<Install Location\>** directory contains the log files documenting each invocation of the installer or uninstaller. To make problem identification easier, provide these log files to Volt MX when reporting an issue.

To install Volt MX Foundry on Tomcat using the installer, follow these steps:

1.  Unzip the `VoltMXFoundrySetup.zip` file.
2.  Double-click `VoltMXFoundryInstaller-x.x.x.x_GA.exe` to launch the installer.
    The **InstallAnywhere** dialog appears. The **InstallAnyWhere** dialog displays information about the progress of the software installation at run time.

    Installation environment is set to Development by default . Choose one of the install type based on your requirement.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/MF_InstallType_577x469.png)
    
7.  Select the **Send usage data anonymously** check box. This allows HCL to collect product usage information to make your Volt MX Foundry experience better. HCL does not save any of your private or application data. By default this check box is selected.
8.  Click **Next**. The **Choose components to install** window appears.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/Choose_Component.png)
    
9.  Select one or more check boxes for the supported components. By default, the **Console**, **Identity Services**, **Integration Services**, **Developer Portal**, and **Engagement Services** check boxes are selected:
    
    *   **Console** - To install Volt MX Foundry Console, select the **Console** check box.  
        The system creates the following databases: `<prefix>mfconsoledb<suffix>`, `<prefix>mfaccountsdb<suffix>`, and  `<prefix>mfreportsdb<suffix>`.
    *   **Identity Services** - To install Volt MX Identity Services, select the **Identity Services** check box.  
        The system creates the following database: `<prefix>idconfigdb<suffix>`.
    *   **Integration Services** - To install Volt MX Foundry Integration Services, select the **Integration Services** check box.  
        The system creates the following databases: `voltmxadmindb`  and  `mfreportsdb`.
    *   **API Developer Portal** - To install developer portal, select the **API Developer Portal** check box.  
        
        > **_Note:_** During installation if you have selected **API Developer Portal**, the **API Developer Portal** is created. You can directly access your [Volt MX Developer Portal](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/VoltMXDevPortal.md) in Volt MX Foundry Console.
        
    *   **Engagement Services** - To install Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services, select the **Engagement Services** check box.  
        The system creates the following database: `<prefix>vpnsdb<suffix>`.
    
    **Reports Database**
    
    The reports database is used for configuring reports.
    
    The Installer creates the `mfreportsdb` if you are installing the following Volt MX Foundry components:
    
    *   **Console** without Integration Services (with or without Engagement Services)
    *   **Console** and **Integration Services** (with or without Engagement Services)
    *   **Integration Services** without Console (with or without Engagement Services)
    
    > **_Important:_**  If you try to install Integration and Console in different nodes, ensure that you point to the same reports database to make reports feature work properly.
    
    Reports Database for Integration on a Separate Node
    
    While installing console and integration on separate nodes, the installer prompts you to point the reports database during the integration installation.  
      
    For example:  
    You have installed only Console on one node. The installer creates these three databases such as `<>mfreportsdb<>` along with the `<>mfconsoledb<>` and `<>mfaccountsdb<>`. For example, your report database name is `voltmxmfreportsdb1`  
      
    When you install the integration with or without one or more components (identity, or Engagement Services) on a separate node, the installer displays the **Reports Database Name** field in the **Database Details** window. If the installer prompts you to enter the existing reports db, enter the reports database name (for example, `voltmxmfreportsdb1`) in the **Database Details window > Reports Database Name** field. Refer to the [Database Details](#DatabaseDetails) window.  
      
    Refer to [creating a reports database, for example, **<prefix>mfreports<suffix>**](#CreatingReportsDB).  
    
10. Click **Next**. The **Install Folder** window appears. The selected path appears in the **Where would you like to install** field.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/Install5.png)
    
11. Click **Choose** to browse the required folder from your system.
12. Click **Next**. The **Application Server** window appears asking you to choose the application server. By default, the Application Sever is set to Tomcat.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/App_Server.png)
    
13. In the **Application Server** window, click **Tomcat**.  
    
    > **_Note:_**
		By default Tomcat manager password is used by Volt MX Foundry for Web Application publish. To change the default Tomcat manager password, the new password needs to be replaced in the `password` field for the user `manager` in the `<tomcat-users>` tag in the `tomcat-users.xml`.  

		Now to replace the value in database, the password value should be encrypted. To encrypt the database password, follow these steps mentioned in the [Encrypt\_Passwords](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_manual_install_guide/Content/Encrypt_Passwords.md) section.  
      
		Once the password is encrypted, replace the encrypted value in the `prop_value` column in the row where prop\_value is `management_server_password` of `<DatabasePrefix>admindb<DatabaseSuffix>` database in the `server_configuration` table.
    
14. Click **Next**.

    <p id="Step13"></p>
    The <b>HTTP or HTTPS</b> window appears asking you to choose the HTTP or HTTPS. By default, this option is set to <b>HTTP</b>.
