# Introduction to Campaigns using Segments

In this chapter, we will cover the campaigns feature of the Engagement Server. We will explain what campaigns are and show you the creation of campaigns using the segments that were created earlier.

It is assumed that you already have access to trial account of Volt MX Foundry, which has Engagement provisioned. It is also highly recommended that you finish all the chapters of the beginnerâ€™s track and also all the previous chapters of this track before you continue with this chapter.

## Introduction to Campaigns in Engagement

A campaign in the Engagement Server is a scheduled notification mechanism that sends notifications to users in a segment. Campaigns have start and end times associated with them. A segment as you may recall from the earlier chapter, is a subset of users that are contained in the Engagement Server. Segments can be created based on the user attributes or based on the location of the user. Location based segments use geolocations and beacons.

Once the campaigns are created and saved, they run at the scheduled start times and send the various notification messages using the push, email, SMS and passes mechanisms. You can also define a channel priority for the messages that are sent from the campaigns. This ensures that the message can be delivered using the lower priority mechanism, if the higher priority channel does not works. For example, you can have a campaign set up to send notifications using the push and SMS notification channels. Further, you can choose the push mechanism to be of higher priority than the SMS. In this situation, an attempt will be made to deliver the message using push first and, if it fails the message will be delivered using the SMS.

## Campaign Creation in the Engagement Server

5.  Choose **Push** and **SMS** as message channels. Click **Compose Message** of the Push to configure the push message.
6.  Choose **Standard Push** as message type. Type **Florida Resident Campaign** as the message name and message title. Enter the message to be sent. Also since this is a push message, you will need to choose the application name. Choose **EngagementTestApp** from the drop-down list. Click **Save** to save the push message.
7.  Click **Compose SMS** to enter the SMS message to be sent when the campaign is triggered.
8.  Enter the message name in the **SMS Message Name** field. Enter the SMS message in the message box. Click **Save** to save the SMS message.
9.  Now the push message and the SMS message are defined and saved, click **Settings** to set up the channel priority.
10. From the **Send Message to** drop-down list, choose **Any One Channel** as the option. Choose the priority one as the Push message and the priority two as the SMS. This means that the message will be sent using the push message first if that fails an attempt will be made to send the message via SMS. Click **Save** to save the settings.
