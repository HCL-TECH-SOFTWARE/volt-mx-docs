How to Configure the JasperReports Server

1.	Once the JasperReports Server is installed, the Install Complete window appears with the confirmation message. Select the Launch check box to launch the JasperReports Server.  

    The Welcome to Jaspersoft page appears.

    The Getting Started page appears.  

3.	On the Manage menu, click Users.

    > **__Note__**: You need to edit superuser attributes only if reports are going to be run outside of the Foundry Console's context for users of Foundry 9.X and above. <br>
    > For most users of Foundry 9.X and above, reports can be directly accessed from Foundry Console after following the setup steps as mentioned in the  [Post-Installation Tasks](Post-Installation_Tasks.md) and [How to Configure Foundry](How_to_Configure_Foundry.md) in the JasperReports Server sections to finish the post-installation tasks and configuring Foundry Console to communicate with JasperReports Server
