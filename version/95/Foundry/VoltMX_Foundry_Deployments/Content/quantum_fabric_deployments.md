  

Deployments are installation packages that can be used to set up and deploy the individual Foundry components on various platforms, which are run and managed by using containers. These components include the Foundry Console, Identity Services, Integration Services, and Engagement Services.

While is available as a cloud service and on-premise installation, you can also set up and deploy Foundry on your preferred platform (either local or cloud) for development and production requirements.

For more information about the supported platforms, refer to the following table.
