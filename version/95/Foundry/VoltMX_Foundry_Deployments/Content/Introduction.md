Docker is an open platform for developers and system admins to build, ship, and run distributed applications on laptops, data center VMs, or on the cloud. Docker platform is the only container platform that allows users to build, secure, and manage the widest array of applications from development to production both on-premises and on the cloud. Docker enables true independence between applications and infrastructure as well as developers and IT ops to unlock their potential. This creates a model for better collaboration and innovation.

Docker Community Edition provides developers with tools to build applications and Docker Enterprise Edition (EE) provides IT with multi-architecture operations at scale. For more information on Docker, refer [What is Docker?](https://www.docker.com/what-docker)

A container is a lightweight, standalone, and executable package of a piece of a software that includes everything needed to run the code: runtime, system tools, system libraries, and settings. The Docker container is available for both Windows-based and Linux-based apps, and containerized software will always run the same regardless of the environment.
