JavaScript Adapter
------------------

With the JavaScript Adapter, you can integrate plain JavaScript services to applications in Volt MX Foundry.

You can upload custom JavaScript files to Volt MX Foundry. Using JavaScript adapters, you can easily create server-side code and make it available as operations. The JavaScript file must contain functions that a user wants to be made available as operations, along with other supporting functions. You can also add preprocessor and postprocessor to the operations defined. For more details on the structure for JavaScript function definitions, refer to the [Limitations](#limitations-for-javascript-engine-javascript-adapter) section.

For more details about the sample JavaScript code, refer to [JavaScript Sample Code for Preprocessor and Postprocessor](JS_Pre-Post_Samples.md).

Based on the JDK version supported by Volt MX Foundry Installer, the JavaScript adapter uses the following JavaScript engines:

*   If the Java version is 1.7 or 1.8, then the adapter uses Nashorn JavaScript engine
*   If the Java version is below 1.7 , then the adapter uses Rhino JavaScript engine

### Configure JavaScript Endpoint Adapter

To configure JavaScript service in the **[Integration Service Definition](ConfigureIntegrationService.md#IntSD)** tab, follow these steps:

1.  In the **Name** field, provide a unique name for your service.
2.  From the **Service Type** list, select **JavaScript**.  
    
3.  Provide the following details in the JavaScript service definition:  
    

  
      | Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Specify JavaScript libraries | From the **Specify the Javascript libraries** section, select a .JS file, or click **Upload** to select the .JS file from your local machine. The console adds your JS file to the console. The system displays the added JS file's name under the **Specify the Javascript libraries** section.<br><br>The system allows you to upload more than one JS file at **Specify the Javascript libraries**.<br><br>Once uploaded, JavaScript files are available across Volt MX Foundry console. They cannot be deleted, only unlinked. You can unlink uploaded .JS files by clicking the **Unlink** icon.<br><br>**JavaScript file Validation for the JavaScript service:**<br><br> You can validate the associated JavaScript files for the JavaScript service before saving the integration service. To validate the JavaScript file, click the Validate icon available for that file.<br><br>While uploading a JavaScript file, and if the JavaScript file **has no errors**, the **Validation** icon turns into the **Successful Validation File** icon for that file. And the JavaScript file is uploaded to the Workspace.<br> **_Note:_** When you link the validated JavaScript file to another JavaScript service, the **Successful Validation File** icon is displayed for that file in the new JavaScript Service.<br><br>While uploading a JavaScript file, and if the JavaScript file **has errors**, the Console validates the file and displays the **Error** message dialog with a **Download** link to the validation results. When you click **Download**, a .txt file with the validation results will be downloaded to your local system. In this case you must upload a valid JavaScript file and ensure that the upload is successful.<br><br> **_Important:_** While uploading the JavaScript file, and if found errors, the Console does not allow you to upload the file to the Workspace.<br><br>For the existing linked JavaScript files, the validation statuses icons are treated as follows:<br><br>**Validate** icon indicates that the linked JavaScript files are not validated<br><br>**Successful Validation File** icon indicates that the linked JavaScript files are validated, and no errors found.<br><br>**Validation Error** icon indicates that the linked JavaScript files are validated, which contain errors.![](Resources/Images/JSFilevalidation_514x191.png)<br>For example:<br><br>For the linked JavaScript files, the following icons If you click **Validate** for the **linked** JavaScript file, and if the JavaScript file **has no errors**, the **Validation** icon turns into the **Successful Validation File** icon for that file.<br><br> If you click **Validate** for the **linked** JavaScript file, and if the JavaScript file **has errors**, the **Error** message dialog is displayed with a **Download** link to the validation results. When you click **Download**, a .txt file with the validation results will be downloaded to your local system. In this case you must provide a valid JavaScript file, validate the updated file, and only then you can save the service.<br><br> **_Important:_** If you have validated the existing JavaScript file and found errors, the Workspace does not allow you to save the service.<br><br>If you have **not validated** the existing linked JavaScript file, the **Validate** icon for that file is displayed. If you do not want to validate the JavaScript file, and want to save the service, do not click **Validate**. |

  
4. **For additional configuration of your service definition, provide the following details in the Advanced section:** 
    
      | Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Throttling | API throttling enables you to limit the number of request calls within a minute. If an API exceeds the throttling limit, it will not return the service response. <br><br>**To specify throttling in Volt MX Foundry Console, follow these steps:<br><br>** In the **Total Rate Limit** text box, enter a required value. With this value, you can limit the number of requests configured in your Volt MX Foundry console in terms of Total Rate Limit. <br><br>In the **Rate Limit Per IP** text box, enter a required value. With this value, you can limit the number of IP address requests configured in your Volt MX Foundry console in terms of Per IP Rate Limit. <br><br>**To override throttling in App Services Console, refer to** [Override API Throttling Configuration](API_Throttling_Override.md#override-api-throttling-configuration). <br><br>**_Note:_** In case of On-premises, the number of nodes in a clustered environment is set by configuring the `VOLTMX_SERVER_NUMBER_OF_NODES` property in the Admin Console. This property indicates the number of nodes configured in the cluster.<br> The default value is 1. Refer to [The Runtime Configuration tab on the Settings screen of App Services](../../../Foundry/vmf_integrationservice_admin_console_userguide/Content/Runtime_Configuration.md).<br><br> The total limit set in the Volt MX Foundry Console will be divided by the number of configured nodes. For example, a throttling limit of 600 requests/minute with three nodes will be calculated to be 200 requests/minute per node. This is applicable for Cloud and On-premises. |

### Limitations for JavaScript Engine - JavaScript Adapter

*   The JavaScript Engine does not support some common JavaScript libraries and global JavaScript functions such as jQuery, setTimeout, setInterval or XMLHttpRequest. However, it provides an alternate mechanism to perform the same operation. You can invoke the required functionality using Java for such cases. For example, consider the XMLHttpRequest API. Since Nashorn does not support this API, you will need to use Java to perform the required operations. You can use URLConnection java class or HttpClient API to achieve the same goal.
    
*   The JavaScript Engine only supports ECMAScript-262 Edition 5.1. It does not support any features of Edition 6 or any nonstandard features provided by other JavaScript implementations.
*   The JavaScript Engine does not include a browser plug-in API.
*   The JavaScript Engine does not include support for DOM/CSS or any related libraries (such as jQuery, Prototype, or Dojo)
*   The JavaScript Engine does not include direct debugging support.
*   The JavaScript Engine does not support event loop or a task queue.

### Limitations for Supported Function Formats - JavaScript Adapter

*   Supported formats of the JavaScript function definition as follows:
```
 function abc() { … }
```
