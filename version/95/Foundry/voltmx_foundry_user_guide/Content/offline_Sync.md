**Offline Sync (Offline objects)**
==================================

An Offline Object is a solution to the data synchronization problem that Apps face when they must work offline. The Offline object is a new synchronization capability built on the top of Volt MX Foundry Object Services. Using the Offline Objects feature, apps can download data from the Volt MX Foundry Object Services to a mobile device. Apps can continue to use the downloaded data when the device does not have network connectivity. Data can be synced with the Volt MX Foundry Object Services back-end, once the device gets the network.

Let us learn more about offline objects in this video. This video gives information about:

*   The definition of Offline Objects
*   The architecture of Offline Object
*   The configuration of the Offline Object Services
