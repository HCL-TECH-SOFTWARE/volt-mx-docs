Publishing Client Binaries from Volt MX Foundry
==============================================

Using Volt MX Foundry Console, you can publish binaries such as native client binaries to Volt MX Management environment or Volt MX Enterprise Store and web client binaries to the Server.

The following sections help you publish client binaries:

*   [Publishing Native Client Binaries From Volt MX Foundry to EAS](EnterpriseAppStore.md#publishing-apps-to-eas-app-server)
*   [Publishing Native Client Binaries to Volt MX Management Environment](Publish_Native_Client.md)
*   [Publishing Web Client Binaries to the Server](Publishing_Service_Web_Client.md#How)

For more details on uploading client binaries, refer to [Uploading Client Binaries to Volt MX Foundry Console](Upload_Client_Binaries.md#Uploadin).

> **_Important:_**  Make sure that your Volt MX Foundry Console version used for creating apps is same as Volt MX Foundry runtime components’ (Integration, Sync, and Messaging) versions. All the components of Volt MX Foundry must be upgraded to same versions.  
  
For example, if the Volt MX Foundry Console installed version is V8 for creating your apps, you must use the same Volt MX Foundry version for runtime components to publish your apps. If there is a version mismatch, Volt MX Foundry’s Publish functionality and other runtime server components may not work as expected.
