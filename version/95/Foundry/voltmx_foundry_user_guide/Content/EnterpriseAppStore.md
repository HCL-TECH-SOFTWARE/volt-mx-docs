Volt MX  Enterprise App Store (EAS) Service for Digital App Distribution
=======================================================================

Overview
--------

Volt MX  Enterprise App Store (EAS) is a simplified app distribution service that enables an enterprise to securely and easily manage and distribute their apps to their users. All features of Volt MX EAS are available on Cloud and On-Premises.

With Volt MX AppPlatform Release V8 Service Pack 4, Volt MX App Server has been enhanced to provide the backend support for the Volt MX Enterprise App Store.

> **_Note:_** From Volt MX AppPlatform V8 SP4, Volt MX EAS Service is available to all Volt MX AppPlatform users by default.

After an app is built by using Volt MX AppPlatform, Volt MX EAS service allows Volt MX AppPlatform users (**Admin/Member/Owner**) to choose to publish an app to the Volt MX App Server available in their Volt MX Foundry account. AppPlatform users can then allow authenticated access to certain end-users. The authorized end-users can access the published apps directly from Volt MX EAS, just like how you can access apps from the Google Play Store and the Apple App Store.

The following table details Volt MX Foundry roles to manage EAS Apps

*   Set the variable `max_allowed_packet` as per the size of your application:
    
    > **_Important:_** **For on-premises**: If the size of your application is more than the variable size of server database, an error occurs. Ensure the variable `max_allowed_packet` is set to a higher value than the application size.  
      
    To avoid this error, increase the global variable in the server database.  
      
    \- Modify the SQL Statement to set global `max_allowed_packet`\=`10*1024*1024`.  
    In this statement, the server database size is configured to 10-Megabytes(MB).  
      
    For example, if your application size is 1024-kilobytes (1 MB) and you try to publish an application from Volt MX Studio of 2048-Kilobytes(2 MB) an error appears while publishing. Increase the size of server database to a value more than 2048-Kilobytes (2 MB), for publishing the application. Refer to [Increase innodb\_log\_file\_size in my.ini file- MySQL](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_windows_install_guide/Content/DB_Pre-installation_Tasks.md).
    
*   Before you publish apps to EAS you must set the `File Storage Root Directory` path in the **Settings > Runtime Configuration > File Storage Configuration** in App Services Console.
    *   VoltMX Foundry uses client app binaries uploaded to the location set in `File Storage Root Directory` and publishes them to EAS. So, the `File Storage Root Directory` path should be in the same system as the Volt MX Foundry installation.
        
        > **_Important:_** If your Volt MX Foundry is on Windows and the path is in the **D** drive, then provide the value as **D**:  
          
          
          
        For example,  
        Volt MX Foundry is installed on `D:\Installers\VoltMXFoundry`  
        The file path can be `` `D:\Installers\Content\VoltMXEAS` ``

Publishing Apps to EAS (VoltMX App Server)
-------------------------------------------

### Publishing Client Binaries to Volt MX App Server from Volt MX Iris (for Cloud only)

*   With Iris Starter, you can build client binaries and publish them directly to Volt MX App Server from Iris. For more information, refer to [Publishing Native Apps to Enterprise App Store from Iris Starter](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/EAS.md).

> **_Note:_** If you are a Volt MX Iris Enterprise user, you must publish apps to EAS from Volt MX Foundry Console. The behavior of EAS is the same for Volt MX Iris Enterprise and Iris Starter Editions.

### Publishing Client Binaries to Volt MX App Server from Volt MX Foundry

By using Volt MX Foundry, you can directly upload client binaries and publish them to Volt MX App Server. After an app is published to Volt MX App Server, an authorized end-user can access EAS Client app to view available applications and download them using a mobile device.

The following flow diagram explains the process of publishing client binaries to Volt MX App Server by using Volt MX Foundry

![](Resources/Images/FoundryPublishBinarytoEAS_914x778.png)

To publish client binaries to Volt MX App Server by using Volt MX Foundry, follow these steps:

1.  Create an app in Volt MX Foundry.
2.  In the App details page, click the [**Manage Client App Assets**](Upload_Native_Client_Binaries.md#Uploadin) tab for the app. By default, the iOS tab is selected.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/ManageClientAppsAssets.png)
    
3.  **Upload the client binaries for supported platforms such as iOS, Android** , and Web, as follows:
    
    1.  In the **Mange Client App Assets**, click the tab for iOS or Android or Web.
        1.  Click the **UPLOAD** button for the specific channel.  The **Upload** dialog appears for the selected channel.
            
            ![ssdsds](Resources/Images/UploadBinary_306x399.png)  
            (This sample screen shot is for native phone binary upload)
            
            > **_Important:_** **For on-premises**: If the size of your application is more than the variable size of server database, an error occurs. Ensure the variable max\_allowed\_packet\_size is set to a higher value than the application size.  
              
            To avoid this error, increase the global variable in the server database.  
              
            \- Modify the SQL Statement to set global max\_allowed\_packet=10\*1024\*1024.  
            In this statement, the server database size is configured to 10-Megabytes(MB).  
              
            For example, if your application size is 1024-kilobytes (1 MB) and you try to publish an application from Volt MX Studio of 2048-Kilobytes(2 MB) an error appears while publishing. Increase the size of the server database to a value more than 2048-Kilobytes (2 MB) for publishing the application. Refer to [Increase innodb\_log\_file\_size in my.ini file- MySQL](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_windows_install_guide/Content/DB_Pre-installation_Tasks.md).
            
        2.  Drag and drop the app binary or click **Browse** and navigate to the required app binary file.
    
    1.  In the **Display Name** field, specify the name of the application. The app is displayed with the specified name in EAS when you view the App Store in a mobile device. This field is optional.
        
        If the display name is not specified for the app binary, the published app is displayed with the default Volt MX Foundry app name in EAS.
        
    2.  In the **Version** field, add the version for the app.
    3.  To add the app icon, click the **Plus** symbol in the **App Icon** section and navigate to the icon file. This is applicable to native binary.
    4.  To change the screens, click the **Plus** symbol in the **Screenshot** section and navigate to the required image file. This is applicable to native binary.  
    5.  In the **Description** field, add the description of the app.
        
    6.  Click **UPLOAD**. The add details are updated to the selected channel.
        
    
    > **_Important:_** In the case of Web binary, if you have uploaded a Web binary file, you must publish the Web binary to the server as follows:  
      
    1\. Go to the **Publish** tab. By default, the **Service & Web Client Publish** tab is selected.

The Volt MX Enterprise App Store (EAS) is a platform for sharing mobile apps. The default authentication type for EAS is Volt MX User Repository. The authentication type is disabled, by default. After an app is published to Volt MX App Server, users can view your published apps from EAS client app without logging in. You can browse and download apps from the store. An organization that uses Volt MX EAS can customize the user access based on their requirements.

> **_Note:_** By default, from Volt MX AppPlatform V8 SP4, Volt MX EAS Service is available to all users with the **Store URL** that is displayed in the **Your App is ready** dialog window after your app is published.

To secure your apps, you can enable authentication. When you enable authentication to apps in EAS, by default the **VoltMX User Repository** is associated to the **VoltMX App Store** for authentication. All users registered in the Volt MX User Repository are authorized to access this app by specifying log-in credentials.

> **_Note:_** When you log in to EAS by providing login credentials, the login details are stored in the browser settings of the mobile device. So, when you try to launch EAS on the same device next time, your authentication happens automatically, and you can start downloading apps.

> **_Important:_** If you log out from EAS in a mobile device, and try to launch the EAS on the same device next time, the **Log In** screen appears, which helps you to enter the credentials to launch the EAS.  

> **_Note:_** By default, the authentication is disabled for EAS. Users can view your published apps from EAS client app without having to log in.To enable authentication to your app, refer to [Securing Apps in EAS](#securing-apps-in-app-server-for-eas).

You can **enable** authentication to apps in EAS by using **VoltMX Foundry**, **VoltMX Iris Starter**, and **VoltMX App Services Console**.

#### Securing Apps by using Volt MX Foundry

When the app is published, the **Application published** window appears and displays link to the **App Store** and **Manage App Store Users**, along with the **QR Code** to access the EAS.

> **_Important:_** Use the **App Store** link on a browser or scan the displayed **QR** code to launch the Enterprise App Store on your mobile.  
  
You can manage access to EAS by using the **Manage App Store Users** link, which allows you to manage user access to published apps. When you click on the **Manage App Store Users** link, the **My App Store Login** window appears.  
For more information on how to configure users for EAS, refer to [Manage App Store Users](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/EAS.md#Manage).

#### Securing Apps by using Volt MX App Services Console

The following procedure explains how to enable security to an app in EAS.

1.  Log in to App Services Console, where you have published the app for EAS.
2.  Navigate to **Settings**.
3.  Click the **Configuration Parameters** tab.
4.  Click the **Client App Properties** tab and specify the following details:
    *   Field Name: `VOLTMX_APPSTORE_LOGIN`.
        
    *   Field Value: `true`. The Field Value is a case-sensitive in small letters.
        
5.  Click **Save** to save the settings. Now your app has enabled for authentication.
6.  Navigate to the **VoltMX App Store** app in your Volt MX Foundry account.
7.  Click the **Identity** tab. The associated Volt MX User Repository is listed in the **Identity** page. Add users and groups if required. Your app is enabled with authentication for these users.
8.  Publish the **VoltMX App Store** app to the Volt MX App Services environment. Now, when a user launches EAS, the log in screen appears on a mobile device.
    *   In the case of the app that you want to access is protected by an authorization service, the Login page for EAS appears. For example, the following screen is EAS login screen based on OAuth.

9.  Enter the user name and password.
    
10.  Click **SIGN IN**.

Forgot Password for Client Apps for EAS (for Cloud only)
--------------------------------------------------------

The default authentication type for EAS is Volt MX User Repository. After an app is published to Volt MX App Server, any user from Volt MX User Repository can access EAS without authentication by using the URL of the published app.

When you enable authentication to apps in EAS, the authorized users must specify login credentials to access app published to EAS.

In this case if you forget your login password for EAS, you can reset the password by clicking the **Forgot Password** button on the Login screen in your mobile device. An email will be sent to your registered mail account for the resting password.

> **_Note:_** The Forgot Password functionality is only available for Volt MX User Repository auth provider.

Switching Between Identity Services in Volt MX App Store App for EAS
--------------------------------------------------------------------

After you [enable authentication](#Manage) to apps for EAS, you can switch between identity services configured in your Volt MX Foundry account.

1.  Go to Volt MX Foundry Account.
2.  Navigate to the **VoltMX App Store**.
3.  Click the **Identity** tab. The authentication service type is listed in the Identity page. The default identity service type is `User Repository`, and the service name is `AppStoreUserRepository`.
4.  [Configure a new identity service](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/ConfigureIdentiryService.md) or [use an existing identity service](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/Identity14_Manage_Existing.md#how-to-use-an-existing-identity-service).
    
    The new service is listed in the **Identity** page. You need to have only one service in the list. In the case of more than one service listed, the first service from the list is used for authentication.
    
5.  Publish the app to App Server.
    
    Now, the new service is associated to the app, and the existing identity service is unlinked from the app. When a user launches EAS, the user must specify the login credentials configured based on the new identity service that you have associated with the app.
