Invoking an Object Service
==========================

Volt MX  provides programmatic access to the backend data through Online Object Services. You must perform the following steps to gain the access:

1.  Acquire a current instance of your object service.

1.  Use the object service instance with data transfer objects to communicate as needed with your backend.

To acquire a current instance of your object service, refer to [getObjectService Method](getObjectService_Method.md) documentation.

To know more about the methods that act on the Volt MX Foundry endpoint directly, refer to [OnlineObjectService Class](OnlineObjectService_Class.md) documentation.
