Java Adapter
------------

With Java service, you can interact with your software application that does not support restful APIs. A service that uses a custom Java adapter is a Java service. The Java adapter is a custom Java class and you can create a Java adapter either by implementing `com.hcl.voltmx.middleware.common.JavaService` interface or `com.hcl.voltmx.middleware.common.JavaService2` interface. Volt MX recommends to use JavaService2 as you can get an access to `DataControllerRequest` and `DataControllerResponse` objects.

You must load the required JAR files to define a Java service. The JAR files contain the Java classes. The Java classes contain the Java methods. These methods have the logic defined that is required for a service. Java services are mostly used with Webconnector Services.

> **_Note:_** The `middleware-system.jar` helps you to develop a Java adapter. You can download the `middleware-system.jar` from Admin Console's download page.  

> **_Note:_** You should not modify JVM timezone through custom code as modifying it can result in app server outage.

### Data Conversion of a Java Adapter


<details close markdown="block"><summary>Click here for more details</summary>

The data structure of the Volt MX Result object `(com.hcl.voltmx.middleware.datamapping.Result)` shows that all the data is converted, but the complete data in the Volt MX Result object in not exposed as expected. You get a part of the data in Volt MX Foundry because only a few unnamed records are converted into an object instead of an array.

The use of JSON Arrays is particularly important for the mapping of data in user interface segments that require arrays as data input.

The following code details sample original JSON data, data converted to Volt MX Object, and in the result - data converted only limited unnamed records into an object in Volt MX Foundry (loss of data).

{% highlight json %} //Sample: Original JSON Data:

### Writing a Java Class

**To write a Java class for a Java adapter, follow these steps:**

1.  Create a Java adapter either by implementing the `com.hcl.voltmx.middleware.common.JavaService` interface or `com.hcl.voltmx.middleware.common.JavaService2` interface.
2.  When you implement `com.hcl.voltmx.middleware.common.JavaService`, you have to implement the following `invoke()` method with the signature:
```
    public Object invoke(String paramString, Object[] paramArrayOfObject) throws Exception; 
```
3.  When you implement `com.hcl.voltmx.middleware.common.JavaService2`, you have to implement the following `invoke()` method with the signature:
```
 public Object invoke(String methodID, Object[] objectArray, DataControllerRequest request, DataControllerResponse response) throws Exception;
```

### Middleware API to get Output parameters in a Java Service

A middleware API is provided to get the output params/records/datasets configured as part of a service definition of a Java service.

The following is a sample code:

```

    ServiceOutputWrapper serviceOutputWrapper =  request.getServicesManager().getOperationData()
    .getServiceOutputWrapper();
```

> **_Note:_** Request is an instance of data controller request.

### Configure Java Endpoint Adapter

To configure Java service in the **[Integration Service Definition](ConfigureIntegrationService.md)** tab, follow these steps:

![](Resources/Images/JavaAdapter.PNG)

1.  In the **Name** field, provide a unique name for your service.
2.  From the **Service Type** list, select **Java**.
3.  From the **Java Connector JARs** list, select the required JAR file that contains the classes that implement the JavaService interface for this Integration Service from existing JARs in the account or click **UploadNew** to select the JARs from your local machine.  
    

    > **_Note:_** You can select multiple JAR files from the **Java Connector JARs** list if required.

### Configure Request Operation for Java

Integration services accept only `form-url-encoded` inputs for all the input parameters provided in the service input parameters (request input).

To forward the body of the client's request to backend as it is, select the **Enable pass-through input body** check box. For more details on API Proxy service, refer to [](#APIProxyCheckBox)[How to Enable Pass-through Proxy for Operations](API_Proxy_Adapter.md#how-to-enable-pass-through-proxy-for-operations).

You can perform the following actions in Request Input tab:

1.  Click **Add Parameter** to add an entry (if the entries for input and the output tabs does not exist).
2.  To make duplicate entries, select the check box for the entry, click **Copy** and **Paste**.
3.  To delete an entry, select the check box for an entry and click **Delete** .
4.  To configure the request input tab, provide the following details:  
    
| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | It Contains a Unique Identifier. Change the name if required. |
| Test Value | Enter a value. A test value is used for testing the service. |
| Default Value | Enter the value, if required. The default value will be used if the test value is empty. |
| Scope | Select Request or Session. It is set to **Request** by default. **Request** indicates that the value must be retrieved from the HTTP request received from the mobile device. **Session** indicates that the value must be retrieved from the HTTP session stored on Volt MX Foundry. **Identity**: If this is selected, you can filter the request parameters based on the response from the identity provider. For more details to configure identity filters, refer to [Enhanced Identity Filters - Integration Services](Identity_Filters_Integration.md). |
| Data Type | **Select one of the following data types**<br><br>**String** - A combination of alpha-numeric and special characters. Supports all formats including UTF-8 and UTF-16 with no maximum size limit. <br><br>**Boolean** - A value that can be true or false.<br><br>**Number** - An integer or a floating number.<br><br>**Collection** - A group of data, also referred as data set. |
| Encode | Select the check box to enable encoding of an input parameter. For example, the name New York Times would be encoded as _New_York_Times_ when the encoding is set to True. The encoding must also adhere to the HTML URL encoding standards. |
| Description | Provide a suitable description. |

6.  To validate the operation details, click **Save and Test**. For more details, refer to [Test a Service Operation](Test_a_Service_Operation.md).
    

### Configure Response Operation for Java

1.  Click the **Response Output** tab, and enter the values for required fields such as name, scope, data type, collection ID, record ID, format and format value.
    
    > **_Note:_** If you define parameters inside a record as the session, the session scope will not get reflected for the parameters.
    
    In Java service, the response (output) from a backend is not parsed based on the response values. The complete response from the backend is sent to the client device.
    
    > **_Note:_** By default, the `opStatus` and `httpStatusCode` values for Java and JavaScript services are added as 0 and 200.
    
2.  To validate the operation details, click **Save and Test**. For more details, refer to [Test a Service Operation](Test_a_Service_Operation.md).
    
3.  Click **SAVE OPERATION** to save the operation. The system updates the operation definition.
    
    If you click **Cancel**, the **Edit Service Parameters** window will close without saving any information.
    
    > **_Note:_** To add more operations for your Java service, repeat [Step 3 through Step 4.](#sTEP3)
