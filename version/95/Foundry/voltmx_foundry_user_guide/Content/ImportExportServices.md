Importing and Exporting Services
================================

Volt MX  Foundry lets you import and export services, along with any associated identity and services, JAR files and data adapters. By using the export function, Volt MX Foundry bundles the services, JAR files, and data adapters your service uses together in a ZIP file, which can then be imported by other users into their Volt MX Foundry environments.

The import process will show you any potential conflicts by comparing your current files, JAR files and data adapters with the files in the import package. Any potential conflict will display as an icon on the right side of the service, JAR, or adapter listing in the Import Services window. You can get more information about the potential conflict and how to resolve it by hovering your mouse cursor over the icon.

Some of the possible warnings you might see during the import process are:

*   The service, JAR, or adapter already exists in your account and will be overwritten during the import process. Cancel the import to keep your current resource or continue the import to overwrite the existing resource.
*   A service with the same name, but a different type exists in the account. Rename or delete the existing resource before importing.
*   A read-only service with the same name already exists in the account. Change the service permissions before importing.
