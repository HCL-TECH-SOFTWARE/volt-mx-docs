Invoking an Object Service
--------------------------

Volt MX  supplies you with programmatic access to backend data, both online and offline. To gain access, do the following:

1.  Acquire a current instance of your object service.
2.  Use the object service instance together with data transfer objects to communicate as needed with your backend, either online or offline with a local cache.

To know more about how to acquire a current instance of your object service, refer to [getObjectService Method](getObjectService_Method.md) documentation.

To know more about the methods that act on the Volt MX Foundry endpoint directly, refer to [OnlineObjectServiceClass](OnlineObjectService_Class.md) documentation.

To know more about the methods that act on the local sync database, refer to [OfflineObjectServiceClass](OfflineObjectService_Class.md) documentation.

To know more about the usage of the data transfer objects, refer to [Data Transfer Objects](Data_Transfer_Objects.md) documentation.
