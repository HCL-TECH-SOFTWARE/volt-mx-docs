SAP JCo Adapter
---------------

Volt MX Foundry allows you to connect and access the BAPI functions inside an ABAP SAP backend via SAP JCo Adapter that was built using sapjco java client. Using SAP JCo adapter, you can explore the BAPI functions inside Business Object Repositories (BOR) and Remote Function Call (RFC) and add them as Volt MX Foundry operations in the console. When a BAPI function is added as an operation, its corresponding import params and export params are auto-generated as request input params and response output params.

You must load the required **Business Application Programming Interface** (BAPI) functions to define a SAP service. The BAPI files contain the SAP methods and functions. These methods have the logic defined for a service. A BAPI is a function module as it can be invoked from remote programs such as standalone Java programs, web interfaces, and so on.

**Login and Log Out** - At design time Volt MX Foundry generates the LOGIN and LOGOUT services along with BOR's and RFM's in the root explore, by default. Usually every BAPI function execution requires username and password to be sent in the request. If you want to skip passing the user name and password, you can use the LOGIN and LOGOUT operations.

![](Resources/Images/SAP_JCO/login_logout.png)

**Login** - The Login operation contains two input params, username and password, used to skip passing the user name and password for subsequent BAPI function calls. When you make a LOGIN call, the credentials you provide are stored into the middleware session.

**Log out** - The log out operation is used to remove the stored user name and password from the middleware session.

### Single Sign On (SSO) Login

SAP offers several mechanisms for authenticating users. If there are multiple systems in your system network, using a single sign-on (SSO) environment helps to reduce the number of passwords you must remember. SSO eases user interaction with the available systems, components, and applications . After authentication , users can use the portal to access different systems without repeatedly entering their user information for authentication.

To use SSO login, set the **Login Type** to SSO Login and provide the values for Portal Host and Portal Port (which are mandatory for SSO login) in connection properties. When you add a BAPI function from an SSO enabled backend as an operation (along with BAPI import params list from backend), two additional input params such as username, password, and a header named SSO-TOKEN are generated by Volt MX Foundry. Change the scope for username, password, and SSO-TOKEN from request to session.

> **_Note:_** In SSO Login type, user must call LOGIN before invoking a BAPI function.

### Non-SSO Login

To use NON-SSO login, the Login Type must be set to NON-SSO in connection properties. BAPI function of a NON-SSO enabled SAP backend is added as an operation (along with BAPI import param list from backend), two additional input params username and password are generated by Volt MX Foundry. For every call, the BAPI function is invoked directly by passing the username and password. You can also invoke by changing the scope of username and password input parameters from request to session and using the LOGIN and LOGOUT operations.

    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Custom Code | Custom Code enables you to specify dependent JAR. To specify a dependent JAR, select the JAR containing preprocessor or postprocessor libraries from the list, or click **Upload New** to select the JAR file from your local system. This step allows you to further filter the data sent to the backend.> **_Important:_** Make sure that you upload a custom JAR file that is built on the same JDK version used for installing Volt MX Foundry Integration. For example, if the JDK version on the machine where Volt MX Foundry Integration is installed is 1.6, you must use the same JDK version to build your custom jar files. If the JDK version is different, an unsupported class version error will appears when a service is invoked from a device. |
    | API Throttling | If you want to use **API throttling** in Volt MX Foundry Console to limit the number of request calls within a minute, do the following: *  In the **Total Rate Limit** text box, enter a value. This will limit the total number of requests processed by this API. *  In the **Rate Limit Per IP** field, enter a value. With this value, you can limit the number of IP address requests configured in your Volt MX Foundry console in terms of Per IP Rate Limit. *  To override throttling from Volt MX Foundry App Services Console, refer to [Override API Throttling Configuration](API_Throttling_Override.md#override-api-throttling-configuration). > **_Note:_** In case of On-premises, the number of nodes in a cluster environment is set by configuring the VOLTMX\_SERVER\_NUMBER\_OF\_NODES property in Admin Console. This property indicates the number of nodes configured in the cluster. The default value is 1. Refer to [The Runtime Configuration tab on the Settings screen of App Services](../../../Foundry/vmf_integrationservice_admin_console_userguide/Content/Runtime_Configuration.md). The total throttling limit set in Volt MX Foundry Console is divided by the number of configured nodes. For example, a throttling limit of 600 requests/minute with three nodes will be calculated to be 200 requests/minute per node. This is applicable for Cloud and On-premises. |
