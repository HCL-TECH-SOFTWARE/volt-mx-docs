    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Throttling | API throttling enables you to limit the number of request calls within a minute. If an API exceeds the throttling limit, it will not return the service response. **To specify throttling in VoltMX Foundry Console, follow these steps:** In the **Total Rate Limit** text box, enter a required value. With this value, you can limit the number of requests configured in your VoltMX Foundry console in terms of Total Rate Limit. In the **Rate Limit Per IP** text box, enter a required value. With this value, you can limit the number of IP address requests configured in your VoltMX Foundry console in terms of Per IP Rate Limit. **To override throttling in App Services Console, refer to** [Override API Throttling Configuration](API_Throttling_Override.md#override-api-throttling-configuration). > **_Note:_** In case of On-premises, the number of nodes in a clustered environment is set by configuring the `VOLTMX_SERVER_NUMBER_OF_NODES` property in the Admin Console. This property indicates the number of nodes configured in the cluster. The default value is 1. Refer to [The Runtime Configuration tab on the Settings screen of App Services](../../../Foundry/vmf_integrationservice_admin_console_userguide/Content/Runtime_Configuration.md). The total limit set in the VoltMX Foundry Console will be divided by the number of configured nodes. For example, a throttling limit of 600 requests/minute with three nodes will be calculated to be 200 requests/minute per node. This is applicable for Cloud and On-premises. |
