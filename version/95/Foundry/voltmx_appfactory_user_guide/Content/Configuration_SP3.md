                          

Configuration
-------------

To run a build flow navigate to the **buildIrisApp** job under new App Factory project folder, select **Build with Parameters** button in the menu on the left side of the screen. If it is the first time you perform a build, you need to configure the build job. For future builds, the App Factory stores the settings from the previous build to make configurations of the future builds easy. The following steps and screenshots show how to access the **Build with Parameters** for the job.

1.  Open an app project folder and navigate to **Iris/Builds/buildIrisApp**.

3.  You can execute **Build with parameters** on the job in the following ways.
    
    *   On the right of job list, you can select the icon which represents **Build with Parameters** action.
    *   You can open drop-down menu at the **buildIrisApp** job and choose **Build with Parameters** action from the list.
    *   You can open the **buildIrisApp** job and execute **Build with Parameters** action on the left panel of the job.

4.  At the third the user can open the **buildIrisApp** job and execute **Build with Parameters** action at the left panel of the job.

![](Resources/Images/Config_BuildWithParameters.png)

The **buildIrisApp** job allows you to choose multiple channels to build, what environment you want to deploy to and the mode to build the application. Before running the build, you need to provide all required parameters that are listed and choose required channels to build.

There are several groups of parameters that are required to run Facade job. The parameters are as following:

1.  **Source control related**
    *   **PROJECT\_SOURCE\_CODE\_BRANCH** - branch required to point Git client to the branch you push your application code. Git is supported only.
    *   **PROJECT\_SOURCE\_CODE\_REPOSITORY\_CREDENTIALS\_ID** is required for access to repository where your Iris project is stored.
        
        > **_Important:_** Provide Git credentials depending on git URL format. If https link is provided, then user credentials (Username and password) are sufficient. In case of ssh link - ssh key needs to be added.
        
    
    ![](Resources/Images/source_control.png)
    
    > **_Note:_** If your repository is protected with 2fa in GitHub, add the credentials using **secret text** method. For steps, refer [Adding New Source Code Repository Credentials.](ManagingCredentials.md#Adding_SourceCode)
    
2.  **VoltMX Iris & Volt MX Foundry related parameters**:
    *   **BUILD\_MODE** allows Debug, Release, or Release-Protected mode. Debug build mode adds debug information at binaries that increase their size and allows debug problematic code.
        
        ![](Resources/Images/Build_Mode_598x86.png)
        
        > **_Note:_** If you are building your project for automated testing, you must build your project in **Release** or **Release-protected** mode.  
          
        If you build in **Debug** mode, the landing screen in the generated app will be VoltMX's debugger screen (which your test automation scripts will most likely not be prepared to navigate away from).  
          
        If you choose to build your Iris project in **Release** mode, this mode will not enable additional security and build the application in release unprotected mode.  
          
        If you choose to build your Iris project in **Release-protected** mode, this mode enables additional security with encryption keys. This is the value you enter in build UI mode at **Project Settings**\>> **Native**\>> **iPhone/iPad/Watch or Android** >> **Protected Mode** in Iris.  
        For more information about the protected mode, refer Iris User Guide.
        
        > **_Important:_** Set the Android KeyStore options for Release build mode. Refer to description of Android related parameters.
        
    *   **CLOUD\_CREDENTIALS\_ID** - Volt MX Cloud credentials
    *   **FOUNDRY\_APP\_CONFIG** - Volt MX Foundry app name, environment name, app key, secret, service URL credentials type parameter, that is used to insert corresponding list of values into the Iris app. This is to use these values to initialize the client SDK and point to the right Volt MX Foundry app in the right cloud Environment.
    *   **DEFAULT\_LOCALE** - Example: EN
