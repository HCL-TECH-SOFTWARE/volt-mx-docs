Overview
========

An **Engagement Services** campaign is a series of operations intended to achieve a particular objective involving a specific segment. A campaign may refer to an advertising campaign, a political campaign, or a banking campaign. A segment is obtained from different conditions based on a user's attributes, and is used to send campaign messages to users.

Volt MX  **Engagement** Services allows you to set up campaigns whose target is one or more segments. Users can receive campaign messages through push messages, emails, SMS, and Apple passes. For example, an admin user sends sales campaign messages to a group of users that matches specific conditions and demographics (marital status, income, education) for a particular period. Using the **Engagement** server, the admin user can send multiple campaign notifications to the targeted segments.

The QuickStart guide provides instructions to configure and execute a sample campaign. We also provide instructions on how you can use campaigns to send email, SMS, push, and passbook notifications.

Before you execute the steps from the QuickStart Guide, you need to take care of the following prerequisites:

*   Download the **Engagement** Services demo client application and subscribe to the **Engagement** server.

*   You need to configure the **Engagement** Services demo application on the **Engagement** sever using the **Engagement** Services console.
*   You need to configure the SMS and the email service provider settings on the **Engagement** server so that the **Engagement** Services demo client application can receive email and SMS notifications.
*   The **Engagement** Services demo client application should have already created the subscriptions and can receive the ad hoc email, SMS, and push notifications.
*   You need to create the passbook template to use with campaign notifications.
