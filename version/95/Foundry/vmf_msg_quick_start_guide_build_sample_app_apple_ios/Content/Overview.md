The Quick Start guide provides deep-dive instructions to configure, build and run an **Engagement** services demo application on an iOS device. The guide explains you how to install and run the sample **Engagement** services demo application using a user generated **Apple Push Notification** (APNS) certificate. The guide explains how to install and configure the sample **Engagement** services demo application on a separate instance of **Engagement** server. The installed application will subscribe to the **Engagement** server instance and receive the ad hoc push, email, and SMS notifications.

The QuickStart guide assumes the following:

*   You have requested an instance of **Engagement** server and have access to it.
*   You have installed **Xcode** and **Iris**.

1.  Create the **Apple Push Notification Service** (APNS) certificate that is needed to receive push notifications on iOS devices.
2.  Generate the provisioning profile needed to install the application on iOS devices.
3.  Download and configure the **Engagement** services client application using **Iris**.
4.  Install the configured client application on an iOS device.
5.  Configure the **Engagement** services demo application on the **Engagement** server using the console.
6.  Configure the SMS provider and SMTP server details on the **Engagement** server to send the ad hoc notifications.
7.  Use the **Engagement** services client demo application to subscribe and receive ad hoc email, SMS and push notifications.
