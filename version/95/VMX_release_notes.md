### V9 Servicepack 5 Fixpack 4

December 05, 2022

<details close markdown="block"><summary> Micro Apps Architecture </summary>

Large applications can now be modularized into smaller applications using the Micro apps architecture. Users can create micro-apps that can be joined together in any order and combination to form a number of larger super-applications. Micro apps reduce the complexity for application developers by dividing large apps into smaller and easily manageable independent apps.

Some features of micro apps include : 

#### Micro Apps Enhancements 


#### Update the Combination of Micro Applications in a Project

Developers can specify which micro-apps go into a particular build. By selecting sub-sets of a collection of micro-apps, it is possible to create a whole range of super-apps. One can simply link/unlink micro-apps for a build without having to app on/clean up the code in the super-app project.

#### Update the Order of Micro Applications in a Project

Developers can specify the priority order of Micro Apps in a Composite/Super app. The priority order of Micro Apps helps users set the order of precedence for the resources present in the Super app.

#### Import and Export a Project with Micro Apps

It is possible to import and export projects that contain Micro Apps from Volt MX Iris along with the associated Volt Foundry Services.

#### Create Test Suites and Test Plans for Micro App Projects

Volt MX Iris has introduced enhancements to test-automation to create test suites and test plans containing test cases from the dependent Micro Apps present in a Composite app. It is possible to, much like with the micro-apps themselves, be able to run a selection of test-suites connected with active micro-apps within a project.

#### Export Composite App Themes

It is possible to export Themes from a Composite App with or without exporting the Themes from the linked Micro Apps.

#### Support for Wearables in Micro Apps

Developers are able to export logic for a wearable app (such as Forms, Glances, Notifications, and Modules) in a Micro App. HCL Volt MX recommends that users maintain all the logic for the wearable app in a single Micro App to avoid issues during the build process.
