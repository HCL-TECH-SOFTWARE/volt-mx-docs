### V9 Servicepack 5 Fixpack 4

December 05, 2022

<details close markdown="block"><summary> Micro Apps Architecture </summary>

Large applications can now be modularized into smaller applications using the Micro apps architecture. Users can create micro-apps that can be joined together in any order and combination to form a number of larger super-applications. Micro apps reduce the complexity for application developers by dividing large apps into smaller and easily manageable independent apps.

Some features of micro apps include : 

#### Micro Apps Enhancements 


#### Update the Combination of Micro Applications in a Project

Developers can specify which micro-apps go into a particular build. By selecting sub-sets of a collection of micro-apps, it is possible to create a whole range of super-apps. One can simply link/unlink micro-apps for a build without having to app on/clean up the code in the super-app project.

#### Update the Order of Micro Applications in a Project

Developers can specify the priority order of Micro Apps in a Composite/Super app. The priority order of Micro Apps helps users set the order of precedence for the resources present in the Super app.

#### Import and Export a Project with Micro Apps

It is possible to import and export projects that contain Micro Apps from Volt MX Iris along with the associated Volt Foundry Services.

#### Create Test Suites and Test Plans for Micro App Projects

Volt MX Iris has introduced enhancements to test-automation to create test suites and test plans containing test cases from the dependent Micro Apps present in a Composite app. It is possible to, much like with the micro-apps themselves, be able to run a selection of test-suites connected with active micro-apps within a project.

#### Export Composite App Themes

It is possible to export Themes from a Composite App with or without exporting the Themes from the linked Micro Apps.

#### Support for Wearables in Micro Apps

Developers are able to export logic for a wearable app (such as Forms, Glances, Notifications, and Modules) in a Micro App. HCL Volt MX recommends that users maintain all the logic for the wearable app in a single Micro App to avoid issues during the build process.

</details>

<details close markdown="block"><summary>Navigation Manager</summary>

It is now possible to define a model-driven navigation via the new Navigation Manager, where the entire navigation flow of the app resides in a single place. Users can use the Navigation Manager to define the navigations between the forms and between multiple Micro Apps. The model-driven navigation approach enhances the readability of the application flow and the maintainability of the application code.

In addition, support for the [voltmx.mvc.resolveNameFromContext](./Iris/voltmx_ref_arch_api/Content/NavigationManager.html#navigation-manager), the [voltmx.mvc.getNavigationManager](./Iris/voltmx_ref_arch_api/Content/NavigationManager.html#navigation-manager), and the [voltmx.mvc.getApplicationManager](./Iris/voltmx_ref_arch_api/Content/NavigationManager.html#navigation-manager) APIs has been added in Volt MX Iris to support the usage of the Navigation Manager.

</details>


<details close markdown="block"><summary>Configure Style Constants</summary>

Volt MX Iris has introduced support to configure Style Constants for Colors and Fonts. Using the Style Constants feature, users can create and apply pre-defined styles for colors and fonts, and use these styles in the skins throughout the project. This helps the app developers to easily manage their application branding through the style constants. In addition, from Volt MX Iris V9 Service Pack 5, the Skins tab in the Project Explorer has been renamed as the Themes tab.

Further, from Volt MX Iris V9 Service Pack 5, developers can select a color for a widget's background skin by using a color picker.

#### Style Constant Enhancements 

Volt MX Iris has introduced support to [Import](./Iris/iris_microapps/Content/MicroApp.html#import-a-project-with-micro-apps#import-a-project-with-micro-apps) and [Export](./Iris/iris_microapps/Content/MicroApp.html#import-a-project-with-micro-apps#export-a-project-with-micro-apps) Style Constants along with the associated resources.

In addition, support to define Style Constants for Color with the Two Step Gradient and Multi Step Gradient Color Types has been added in Volt MX Iris.

</details>


<details close markdown="block"><summary>Filters For Project Explorer</summary>

Volt MX Iris now provides the capability to optimize the project explorer view for each tab by configuring the visibility of different entities and channels. This filter can be applied to nodes in a project and for each Micro App in case of a larger application. The filter enables users to declutter the project explorer palette by hiding unused or empty nodes.</details>

<details close markdown="block"><summary>Developer Productivity Features</summary>

Several new features to further simplify app design and development experience to enhance productivity of app developers.

* Support for [Pinning and distribution tools](./Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Look.md#widget-align) have been added in the Properties panel for widgets and containers. By using widget pinning, you can align child widgets in reference to the parent widget and the neighboring widgets to simplify the widget layout.

* Support for the Color Picker has been added to select color swatches from the project.

* Support for the Search option has been added in the Fonts section to select Fonts from the project.

* Enhancements have been made to simplify the development of applications while adhering to Accessibility guidelines.

* Improvements have been made to the application build time.

The Data Panel and Action Editor now support the listing of the fields for Custom XML mappings in a Volt MX Foundry Object Service.

</details>


<details close markdown="block"><summary>Component Updates</summary>

#### Create a New View for a Component

It is now possible to create, configure and manage multiple views for a component (with contract) based on business requirements.

#### Create and Extend a Business Controller for a Component

Volt MX Iris has introduced support to create a business controller for a component with a contract. The business controller contains the business logic of the component.

It is also possible to extend the business controller of the component.

Users can only create one BusinessController for a component, and create only one extension for the BusinessController.

#### Expose Child Components of a Nested Component

Child components of a Nested component can now be exposed. When one exposes a child component within another component, the child component appears under the parent component in the Project Explorer. All the pass-through and custom properties, events, and methods of the child component then appear in the Properties pane when one selects the child component.

#### Support for Color as a Property Type for Components with Contract

‘Color’ is introduced as a Property Type for custom properties in the Manage Properties section for components with contract.

#### Support to Delete Associated Assets of a Component

Cascade-deletion of associated skins and assets along with a component is now possible.

</details>

<details close markdown="block"><summary>Support for iOS App Clips</summary>

Support to integrate iOS App Clips in Volt MX Iris. An app clip is a lightweight part of an app that is discoverable, when needed, and lets users perform everyday tasks swiftly, without downloading and installing the full app. Developers can recommend installing the full app through the App Clip by using the voltmx.application.recommendApp API.
</details>

<details close markdown="block"><summary>Configure iOS Home Screen Widgets</summary>

Support to integrate iOS Home Screen Widgets in Volt MX Iris has been introduced. A widget elevates key content from an app and displays it on the home screen of an iPhone or iPad, where users can see it at a glance. To use iOS Home Screen widgets, developers must include the widget configuration in the .kar file of the app.

</details>


<details close markdown="block"><summary>Support for App Level containers</summary>

Support for the [voltmx.application.setAppLevelWidget API.](./Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/voltmx.application_functions.md#setAppLevelWidget#voltmxapplication-namespace) This enables app developers to design Headers and Footers consistently in iOS and Android that span across multiple forms.

In addition, from the Volt MX V9 Service Pack 5 release, support for the [appLevelWidgetConfig property](./Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/FlexForm_Properties.md#appLevelWidgetConfig#flexform-properties) has been added in the FlexForm widget to enable or disable the header or footer of the app for that particular Form.
</details>

<details close markdown="block"><summary>Widget Enhancements</summary>

#### Extended Widget Support in Segment Template

Support for the Widget Extensions feature for a Segment Template. By using the Widget Extensions feature, developers can customize an existing Volt MX widget's properties to perform a specific task. This customized widget can then be used within a Segment Template like any other Volt MX widget.

#### Support to Block Pop-Ups in the Browser widget

Volt MX Iris has introduced support to block pop-ups from appearing in the Browser widget by using the [isPopUpBlockEnabled](./Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/Browser_Properties.md#isPopUpBlockEnabled#) property.

#### Support to Automatically Resize the TextArea widget

Support to dynamically resize the TextArea widget based on the number of lines of text entered. If the text exceeds the maximum limit, a scroll bar appears in the TextArea widget.

#### Support to Provide String values for the autoComplete property of the TextBox widget

Support to provide string values for the autoComplete property of the TextBox widget.

#### Group Elements in Container Widgets

Support for the shouldGroup property in the [FlexContainer](./Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/FlexContainer_Properties.md#shouldGroup#flexcontainer-properties) and [FlexScrollContainer](./Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/FlexScrollContainer_Properties.md#shouldGroup#flexscrollcontainer-properties) widgets. The shouldGroup property enables the grouping of elements within a Container widget to mitigate redundancy while invoking multiple elements with the same context.

#### Calendar Widget Enhancements

Support for the [calendarStyle](./Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/Calendar_Properties.md#calendarStyle#calendar-properties) property to define the style of the Calendar (when the viewType is set as CALENDAR_VIEW_TYPE_NATIVE) that must be displayed in iOS apps.

In addition, Volt MX Iris has introduced support for the [applyCellSkinsFontStyles](./Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/Calendar_Properties.md#calendarStyle#calendar-properties) property to specify whether font attributes (such as Font Size, Font Family, Font Weight, and Font Style) must be applied to the Calendar widget in Android apps.

#### Copy and Paste Special Characters in a TextBox widget

Support to copy and paste the special characters hyphen '-' in a TextBox widget by providing a combination of values for the keyBoardStyle and the textInputMode properties.

#### Text Widget Enhancement

Support for the textCopyable property in the [TextBox](./Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/TextBox_Properties.md#textcontenttype#textbox-properties) and [TextArea](./Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/TextBox_Properties.md#textcontenttype#textbox-properties) widgets on the Android platform.
