 A CipherOutputStream is composed of an OutputStream and a Cipher so
 that write() methods first process the data before writing them out
 to the underlying OutputStream.  The cipher must be fully
 initialized before being used by a CipherOutputStream.

 &lt;p&gt; For example, if the cipher is initialized for encryption, the
 CipherOutputStream will attempt to encrypt data before writing out the
 encrypted data.

 &lt;p&gt; This class adheres strictly to the semantics, especially the
 failure semantics, of its ancestor classes
 java.io.OutputStream and java.io.FilterOutputStream.  This class
 has exactly those methods specified in its ancestor classes, and
 overrides them all.  Moreover, this class catches all exceptions
 that are not thrown by its ancestor classes.

 &lt;p&gt; It is crucial for a programmer using this class not to use
 methods that are not defined or overriden in this class (such as a
 new method or constructor that is later added to one of the super
 classes), because the design and implementation of those methods
 are unlikely to have considered security impact with regard to
 CipherOutputStream.
