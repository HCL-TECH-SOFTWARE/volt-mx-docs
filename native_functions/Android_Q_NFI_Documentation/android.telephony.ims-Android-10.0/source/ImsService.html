</span>@extends android.app.Service

 Main ImsService implementation, which binds via the Telephony ImsResolver. Services that extend
 ImsService must register the service in their AndroidManifest to be detected by the framework.
 First, the application must declare that they use the &quot;android.permission.BIND_IMS_SERVICE&quot;
 permission. Then, the ImsService definition in the manifest must follow the following format:

 ...
 &lt;service android:name=&quot;.EgImsService&quot;
     android:permission=&quot;android.permission.BIND_IMS_SERVICE&quot; &gt;
     ...
     &lt;intent-filter&gt;
         &lt;action android:name=&quot;android.telephony.ims.ImsService&quot; /&gt;
     &lt;/intent-filter&gt;
 &lt;/service&gt;
 ...

 The telephony framework will then bind to the ImsService you have defined in your manifest
 if you are either:
 1) Defined as the default ImsService for the device in the device overlay using
    &quot;config_ims_package&quot;.
 2) Defined as a Carrier Provided ImsService in the Carrier Configuration using
    {@link CarrierConfigManager#KEY_CONFIG_IMS_PACKAGE_OVERRIDE_STRING}.

 There are two ways to define to the platform which {@link ImsFeature}s this {@link android.telephony.ims.ImsService}
 supports, dynamic or static definitions.

 In the static definition, the {@link ImsFeature}s that are supported are defined in the service
 definition of the AndroidManifest.xml file as metadata:
 &lt;!-- Apps must declare which features they support as metadata. The different categories are
      defined below. In this example, the MMTEL_FEATURE feature is supported. --&gt;
 &lt;meta-data android:name=&quot;android.telephony.ims.MMTEL_FEATURE&quot; android:value=&quot;true&quot; /&gt;

 The features that are currently supported in an ImsService are:
 - RCS_FEATURE: This ImsService implements the RcsFeature class.
 - MMTEL_FEATURE: This ImsService implements the MmTelFeature class.
 - EMERGENCY_MMTEL_FEATURE: This ImsService supports Emergency Calling for MMTEL, must be
   declared along with the MMTEL_FEATURE. If this is not specified, the framework will use
   circuit switch for emergency calling.

 In the dynamic definition, the supported features are not specified in the service definition
 of the AndroidManifest. Instead, the framework binds to this service and calls
 {@link #querySupportedImsFeatures}(). The {@link android.telephony.ims.ImsService} then returns an
 {@link ImsFeatureConfiguration}, which the framework uses to initialize the supported
 {@link ImsFeature}s. If at any time, the list of supported {@link ImsFeature}s changes,
 {@link #onUpdateSupportedImsFeatures}(ImsFeatureConfiguration) can be called to tell the
 framework of the changes.
