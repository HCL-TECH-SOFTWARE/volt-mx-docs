</span> implements android.content.ComponentCallbacks2

 implements android.view.View.OnCreateContextMenuListener

@extends java.lang.Object

 A Fragment is a piece of an application's user interface or behavior
 that can be placed in an {@link android.app.Activity}.  Interaction with fragments
 is done through {@link android.app.FragmentManager}, which can be obtained via
 {@link android.app.Activity#getFragmentManager() android.app.Activity.getFragmentManager()} and
 {@link android.app.Fragment#getandroid.app.FragmentManager() android.app.Fragment.getandroid.app.FragmentManager()}.

 &lt;p&gt;The Fragment class can be used many ways to achieve a wide variety of
 results. In its core, it represents a particular operation or interface
 that is running within a larger {@link android.app.Activity}.  A Fragment is closely
 tied to the Activity it is in, and can not be used apart from one.  Though
 Fragment defines its own lifecycle, that lifecycle is dependent on its
 activity: if the activity is stopped, no fragments inside of it can be
 started; when the activity is destroyed, all fragments will be destroyed.

 &lt;p&gt;All subclasses of Fragment must include a public no-argument constructor.
 The framework will often re-instantiate a fragment class when needed,
 in particular during state restore, and needs to be able to find this
 constructor to instantiate it.  If the no-argument constructor is not
 available, a runtime exception will occur in some cases during state
 restore.

 &lt;h3&gt;Older Platforms&lt;/h3&gt;

 While the Fragment API was introduced in
 {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#HONEYCOMB}, a version of the API
 at is also available for use on older platforms through
 {@link android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity}.  See the blog post
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2011/03/fragments-for-all.html&quot;&gt;
 Fragments For All&lt;/a&gt; for more details.

 &lt;a name=&quot;Lifecycle&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Lifecycle&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Though a Fragment's lifecycle is tied to its owning activity, it has
 its own wrinkle on the standard activity lifecycle.  It includes basic
 activity lifecycle methods such as {@link #onResume}, but also important
 are methods related to interactions with the activity and UI generation.

 &lt;p&gt;The core series of lifecycle methods that are called to bring a fragment
 up to resumed state (interacting with the user) are:

 &lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onAttach} called once the fragment is associated with its activity.
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onCreate} called to do initial creation of the fragment.
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onCreateView} creates and returns the view hierarchy associated
 with the fragment.
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onActivityCreated} tells the fragment that its activity has
 completed its own {@link android.app.Activity#onCreate android.app.Activity.onCreate()}.
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onViewStateRestored} tells the fragment that all of the saved
 state of its view hierarchy has been restored.
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onStart} makes the fragment visible to the user (based on its
 containing activity being started).
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onResume} makes the fragment begin interacting with the user
 (based on its containing activity being resumed).
 &lt;/ol&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As a fragment is no longer being used, it goes through a reverse
 series of callbacks:

 &lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onPause} fragment is no longer interacting with the user either
 because its activity is being paused or a fragment operation is modifying it
 in the activity.
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onStop} fragment is no longer visible to the user either
 because its activity is being stopped or a fragment operation is modifying it
 in the activity.
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onDestroyView} allows the fragment to clean up resources
 associated with its View.
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onDestroy} called to do final cleanup of the fragment's state.
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #onDetach} called immediately prior to the fragment no longer
 being associated with its activity.
 &lt;/ol&gt;

 &lt;a name=&quot;Layout&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Layout&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Fragments can be used as part of your application's layout, allowing
 you to better modularize your code and more easily adjust your user
 interface to the screen it is running on.  As an example, we can look
 at a simple program consisting of a list of items, and display of the
 details of each item.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An activity's layout XML can include &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;fragment&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; tags
 to embed fragment instances inside of the layout.  For example, here is
 a simple layout that embeds one fragment:&lt;/p&gt;

 {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/layout/fragment_layout.xml layout}

 &lt;p&gt;The layout is installed in the activity in the normal way:&lt;/p&gt;

 {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/app/FragmentLayout.java
      main}

 &lt;p&gt;The titles fragment, showing a list of titles, is fairly simple, relying
 on {@link android.app.ListFragment} for most of its work.  Note the implementation of
 clicking an item: depending on the current activity's layout, it can either
 create and display a new fragment to show the details in-place (more about
 this later), or start a new activity to show the details.&lt;/p&gt;

 {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/app/FragmentLayout.java
      titles}

 &lt;p&gt;The details fragment showing the contents of a selected item just
 displays a string of text based on an index of a string array built in to
 the app:&lt;/p&gt;

 {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/app/FragmentLayout.java
      details}

 &lt;p&gt;In this case when the user clicks on a title, there is no details
 container in the current activity, so the titles fragment's click code will
 launch a new activity to display the details fragment:&lt;/p&gt;

 {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/app/FragmentLayout.java
      details_activity}

 &lt;p&gt;However the screen may be large enough to show both the list of titles
 and details about the currently selected title.  To use such a layout on
 a landscape screen, this alternative layout can be placed under layout-land:&lt;/p&gt;

 {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/layout-land/fragment_layout.xml layout}

 &lt;p&gt;Note how the prior code will adjust to this alternative UI flow: the titles
 fragment will now embed the details fragment inside of this activity, and the
 details activity will finish itself if it is running in a configuration
 where the details can be shown in-place.

 &lt;p&gt;When a configuration change causes the activity hosting these fragments
 to restart, its new instance may use a different layout that doesn't
 include the same fragments as the previous layout.  In this case all of
 the previous fragments will still be instantiated and running in the new
 instance.  However, any that are no longer associated with a &amp;lt;fragment&amp;gt;
 tag in the view hierarchy will not have their content view created
 and will return false from {@link #isInLayout}.  (The code here also shows
 how you can determine if a fragment placed in a container is no longer
 running in a layout with that container and avoid creating its view hierarchy
 in that case.)

 &lt;p&gt;The attributes of the &amp;lt;fragment&amp;gt; tag are used to control the
 LayoutParams provided when attaching the fragment's view to the parent
 container.  They can also be parsed by the fragment in {@link #onInflate}
 as parameters.

 &lt;p&gt;The fragment being instantiated must have some kind of unique identifier
 so that it can be re-associated with a previous instance if the parent
 activity needs to be destroyed and recreated.  This can be provided these
 ways:

 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If nothing is explicitly supplied, the view ID of the container will
 be used.
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;android:tag&lt;/code&gt; can be used in &amp;lt;fragment&amp;gt; to provide
 a specific tag name for the fragment.
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;android:id&lt;/code&gt; can be used in &amp;lt;fragment&amp;gt; to provide
 a specific identifier for the fragment.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;a name=&quot;BackStack&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Back Stack&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The transaction in which fragments are modified can be placed on an
 internal back-stack of the owning activity.  When the user presses back
 in the activity, any transactions on the back stack are popped off before
 the activity itself is finished.

 &lt;p&gt;For example, consider this simple fragment that is instantiated with
 an integer argument and displays that in a TextView in its UI:&lt;/p&gt;

 {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/app/FragmentStack.java
      fragment}

 &lt;p&gt;A function that creates a new instance of the fragment, replacing
 whatever current fragment instance is being shown and pushing that change
 on to the back stack could be written as:

 {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/src/com/example/android/apis/app/FragmentStack.java
      add_stack}

 &lt;p&gt;After each call to this function, a new entry is on the stack, and
 pressing back will pop it to return the user to whatever previous state
 the activity UI was in.

 with UI for accepting them. After the user has accepted or rejected the
 requested permissions you will receive a callback on {@link #onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String[], int[])} reporting whether the
 permissions were granted or not.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Note that requesting a permission does not guarantee it will be granted and
 your app should be able to run without having this permission.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 This method may start an activity allowing the user to choose which permissions
 to grant and which to reject. Hence, you should be prepared that your activity
 may be paused and resumed. Further, granting some permissions may require
 a restart of you application. In such a case, the system will recreate the
 activity stack before delivering the result to {@link #onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String[], int[])}.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 When checking whether you have a permission you should use {@link android.content.Context#checkSelfPermission(String)}.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Calling this API for permissions already granted to your app would show UI
 to the user to decide whether the app can still hold these permissions. This
 can be useful if the way your app uses data guarded by the permissions
 changes significantly.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 You cannot request a permission if your activity sets {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestActivity_noHistory noHistory} to
 &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; because in this case the activity would not receive
 result callbacks including {@link #onRequestPermissionsResult(int, String[], int[])}.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 A sample permissions request looks like this:
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;code&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 private void showContacts() {
     if (getActivity().checkSelfPermission(Manifest.permission.READ_CONTACTS)
             != PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
         requestPermissions(new String[]{Manifest.permission.READ_CONTACTS},
                 PERMISSIONS_REQUEST_READ_CONTACTS);
     } else {
         doShowContacts();
     }
 }

 {@literal @}Override
 public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, String[] permissions,
         int[] grantResults) {
     if (requestCode == PERMISSIONS_REQUEST_READ_CONTACTS
             &amp;&amp; grantResults[0] == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
         doShowContacts();
     }
 }
 &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
