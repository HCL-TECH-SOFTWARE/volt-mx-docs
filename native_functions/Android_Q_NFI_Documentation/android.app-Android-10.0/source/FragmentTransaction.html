 the operations will cancel and only fragment B will be added. That means that
 fragment A may not go through the creation/destruction lifecycle.

 The side effect of removing redundant operations is that fragments may have state changes
 out of the expected order. For example, one transaction adds fragment A,
 a second adds fragment B, then a third removes fragment A. Without removing the redundant
 operations, fragment B could expect that while it is being created, fragment A will also
 exist because fragment A will be removed after fragment B was added.
 With removing redundant operations, fragment B cannot expect fragment A to exist when
 it has been created because fragment A's add/remove will be optimized out.
