</span> implements android.os.Parcelable

@extends java.lang.Object

 A description of an Intent and target action to perform with it.  Instances
 of this class are created with {@link #getActivity}, {@link #getActivities},
 {@link #getBroadcast}, and {@link #getService}; the returned object can be
 handed to other applications so that they can perform the action you
 described on your behalf at a later time.

 &lt;p&gt;By giving a PendingIntent to another application,
 you are granting it the right to perform the operation you have specified
 as if the other application was yourself (with the same permissions and
 identity).  As such, you should be careful about how you build the PendingIntent:
 almost always, for example, the base Intent you supply should have the component
 name explicitly set to one of your own components, to ensure it is ultimately
 sent there and nowhere else.

 &lt;p&gt;A PendingIntent itself is simply a reference to a token maintained by
 the system describing the original data used to retrieve it.  This means
 that, even if its owning application's process is killed, the
 PendingIntent itself will remain usable from other processes that
 have been given it.  If the creating application later re-retrieves the
 same kind of PendingIntent (same operation, same Intent action, data,
 categories, and components, and same flags), it will receive a PendingIntent
 representing the same token if that is still valid, and can thus call
 {@link #cancel} to remove it.

 &lt;p&gt;Because of this behavior, it is important to know when two Intents
 are considered to be the same for purposes of retrieving a PendingIntent.
 A common mistake people make is to create multiple PendingIntent objects
 with Intents that only vary in their &quot;extra&quot; contents, expecting to get
 a different PendingIntent each time.  This does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; happen.  The
 parts of the Intent that are used for matching are the same ones defined
 by {@link Intent#filterEquals(Intent) Intent.filterEquals}.  If you use two
 Intent objects that are equivalent as per
 {@link Intent#filterEquals(Intent) Intent.filterEquals}, then you will get
 the same PendingIntent for both of them.

 &lt;p&gt;There are two typical ways to deal with this.

 &lt;p&gt;If you truly need multiple distinct PendingIntent objects active at
 the same time (such as to use as two notifications that are both shown
 at the same time), then you will need to ensure there is something that
 is different about them to associate them with different PendingIntents.
 This may be any of the Intent attributes considered by
 {@link Intent#filterEquals(Intent) Intent.filterEquals}, or different
 request code integers supplied to {@link #getActivity}, {@link #getActivities},
 {@link #getBroadcast}, or {@link #getService}.

 &lt;p&gt;If you only need one PendingIntent active at a time for any of the
 Intents you will use, then you can alternatively use the flags
 {@link #FLAG_CANCEL_CURRENT} or {@link #FLAG_UPDATE_CURRENT} to either
 cancel or modify whatever current PendingIntent is associated with the
 Intent you are supplying.
