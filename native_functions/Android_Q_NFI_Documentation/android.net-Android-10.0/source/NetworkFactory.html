 A NetworkFactory is an entity that creates NetworkAgent objects.
 The bearers register with ConnectivityService using {@link #register} and
 their factory will start receiving scored NetworkRequests.  NetworkRequests
 can be filtered 3 ways: by NetworkCapabilities, by score and more complexly by
 overridden function.  All of these can be dynamic - changing NetworkCapabilities
 or score forces re-evaluation of all current requests.

 If any requests pass the filter some overrideable functions will be called.
 If the bearer only cares about very simple start/stopNetwork callbacks, those
 functions can be overridden.  If the bearer needs more interaction, it can
 override addNetworkRequest and removeNetworkRequest which will give it each
 request that passes their current filters.

 register itself with ConnectivityService using registerNetworkAgent.
 If the bearer cannot immediately satisfy the request (no network,
 user disabled the radio, lower-scored network) it should remember
 any NetworkRequests it may be able to satisfy in the future.  It may
 disregard any that it will never be able to service, for example
 those requiring a different bearer.

            for the future.
            Note that subsequent events may give a different (lower
