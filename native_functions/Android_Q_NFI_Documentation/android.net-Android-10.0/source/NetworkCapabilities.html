 Representation of the capabilities of an active network. Instances are
 typically obtained through
 {@link android.net.NetworkCallback#onCapabilitiesChanged(android.net.Network, android.net.NetworkCapabilities)}
 or {@link android.net.ConnectivityManager#getNetworkCapabilities(Network)}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This replaces the old {@link android.net.ConnectivityManager#TYPE_MOBILE} method of
 network selection. Rather than indicate a need for Wi-Fi because an
 application needs high bandwidth and risk obsolescence when a new, fast
 network appears (like LTE), the application should specify it needs high
 bandwidth. Similarly if an application needs an unmetered network for a bulk
 transfer it can specify that rather than assuming all cellular based
 connections are metered and all Wi-Fi based connections are not.
