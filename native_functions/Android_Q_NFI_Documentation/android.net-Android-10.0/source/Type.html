 A NetworkRequest as used by the system can be one of the following types:

     - LISTEN, for which the framework will issue callbacks about any
       and all networks that match the specified NetworkCapabilities,

     - REQUEST, capable of causing a specific network to be created
       first (e.g. a telephony DUN request), the framework will issue
       callbacks about the single, highest scoring current network
       (if any) that matches the specified NetworkCapabilities, or

     - TRACK_DEFAULT, a hybrid of the two designed such that the
       framework will issue callbacks for the single, highest scoring
       current network (if any) that matches the capabilities of the
       default Internet request (mDefaultRequest), but which cannot cause
       the framework to either create or retain the existence of any
       specific network. Note that from the point of view of the request
       matching code, TRACK_DEFAULT is identical to REQUEST: its special
       behaviour is not due to different semantics, but to the fact that
       the system will only ever create a TRACK_DEFAULT with capabilities
       that are identical to the default request's capabilities, thus
       causing it to share fate in every way with the default request.

     - BACKGROUND_REQUEST, like REQUEST but does not cause any networks
       to retain the NET_CAPABILITY_FOREGROUND capability. A network with
       no foreground requests is in the background. A network that has
       one or more background requests and loses its last foreground
       request to a higher-scoring network will not go into the
       background immediately, but will linger and go into the background
       after the linger timeout.

     - The value NONE is used only by applications. When an application
       creates a NetworkRequest, it does not have a type; the type is set
       by the system depending on the method used to file the request
       (requestNetwork, registerNetworkCallback, etc.).
