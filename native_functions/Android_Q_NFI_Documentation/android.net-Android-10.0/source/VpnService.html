</span>@extends android.app.Service

 VpnService is a base class for applications to extend and build their
 own VPN solutions. In general, it creates a virtual network interface,
 configures addresses and routing rules, and returns a file descriptor
 to the application. Each read from the descriptor retrieves an outgoing
 packet which was routed to the interface. Each write to the descriptor
 injects an incoming packet just like it was received from the interface.
 The interface is running on Internet Protocol (IP), so packets are
 always started with IP headers. The application then completes a VPN
 connection by processing and exchanging packets with the remote server
 over a tunnel.

 &lt;p&gt;Letting applications intercept packets raises huge security concerns.
 A VPN application can easily break the network. Besides, two of them may
 conflict with each other. The system takes several actions to address
 these issues. Here are some key points:
 &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;User action is required the first time an application creates a VPN
       connection.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;There can be only one VPN connection running at the same time. The
       existing interface is deactivated when a new one is created.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;A system-managed notification is shown during the lifetime of a
       VPN connection.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;A system-managed dialog gives the information of the current VPN
       connection. It also provides a button to disconnect.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;The network is restored automatically when the file descriptor is
       closed. It also covers the cases when a VPN application is crashed
       or killed by the system.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There are two primary methods in this class: {@link #prepare} and
 {@link android.net.IpSecTransform.Builder#establish}. The former deals with user action and stops
 the VPN connection created by another application. The latter creates
 a VPN interface using the parameters supplied to the {@link android.net.IpSecTransform.Builder}.
 An application must call {@link #prepare} to grant the right to use
 other methods in this class, and the right can be revoked at any time.
 Here are the general steps to create a VPN connection:
 &lt;ol&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;When the user presses the button to connect, call {@link #prepare}
       and launch the returned intent, if non-null.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;When the application becomes prepared, start the service.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Create a tunnel to the remote server and negotiate the network
       parameters for the VPN connection.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Supply those parameters to a {@link android.net.IpSecTransform.Builder} and create a VPN
       interface by calling {@link android.net.IpSecTransform.Builder#establish}.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;Process and exchange packets between the tunnel and the returned
       file descriptor.&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;When {@link #onRevoke} is invoked, close the file descriptor and
       shut down the tunnel gracefully.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Services extending this class need to be declared with an appropriate
 permission and intent filter. Their access must be secured by
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_VPN_SERVICE} permission, and
 their intent filter must match {@link #SERVICE_INTERFACE} action. Here
 is an example of declaring a VPN service in {@code AndroidManifest.xml}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
 &amp;lt;service android:name=&quot;.ExampleVpnService&quot;
         android:permission=&quot;android.permission.BIND_VPN_SERVICE&quot;&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;intent-filter&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;action android:name=&quot;android.net.VpnService&quot;/&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;/intent-filter&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/service&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; The Android system starts a VPN in the background by calling
 {@link android.content.Context#startService startService()}. In Android 8.0
 (API level 26) and higher, the system places VPN apps on the temporary
 whitelist for a short period so the app can start in the background. The VPN
 app must promote itself to the foreground after it's launched or the system
 will shut down the app.

 owner and profile owner apps through
 {@link DevicePolicyManager#setAlwaysOnVpnPackage}.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;a non-empty array&lt;/strong&gt;: an array of one or more {@link android.net.Network}s, in
 decreasing preference order. For example, if this VPN uses both wifi and mobile (cellular)
 networks to carry app traffic, but prefers or uses wifi more than mobile, wifi should appear
 first in the array.&lt;/li&gt;

 underlying network connection, and thus, app traffic will not be sent or received.&lt;/li&gt;

 APIs mentioned above to send traffic over specific channels.&lt;/li&gt;
