</span> implements java.lang.AutoCloseable

@extends java.lang.Object

 Allows applications to request that the system periodically send specific packets on their
 behalf, using hardware offload to save battery power.

 To request that the system send keepalives, call one of the methods that return a
 {@link android.net.SocketKeepalive} object, such as {@link android.net.ConnectivityManager#createSocketKeepalive},
 passing in a non-null callback. If the {@link android.net.SocketKeepalive} is successfully
 started, the callback's {@code onStarted} method will be called. If an error occurs,
 {@code onError} will be called, specifying one of the {@code ERROR_*} constants in this
 class.

 To stop an existing keepalive, call {@link android.net.SocketKeepalive#stop}. The system will call
 {@link android.net.SocketKeepalive.Callback#onStopped} if the operation was successful or
 {@link android.net.SocketKeepalive.Callback#onError} if an error occurred.

 For cellular, the device MUST support at least 1 keepalive slot.

 For WiFi, the device SHOULD support keepalive offload. If it does not, it MUST reply with
 {@link android.net.SocketKeepalive.Callback#onError} with {@code ERROR_UNSUPPORTED} to any keepalive offload
 request. If it does, it MUST support at least 3 concurrent keepalive slots.
