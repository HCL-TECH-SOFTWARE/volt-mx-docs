 JetPlayer provides access to JET content playback and control.
 
 &lt;p&gt;Please refer to the JET Creator User Manual for a presentation of the JET interactive
 music concept and how to use the JetCreator tool to create content to be player by JetPlayer.
 
 &lt;p&gt;Use of the JetPlayer class is based around the playback of a number of JET segments
 sequentially added to a playback FIFO queue. The rendering of the MIDI content stored in each
 segment can be dynamically affected by two mechanisms:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;tracks in a segment can be muted or unmuted at any moment, individually or through
    a mask (to change the mute state of multiple tracks at once)&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;parts of tracks in a segment can be played at predefined points in the segment, in order
    to maintain synchronization with the other tracks in the segment. This is achieved through
    the notion of &quot;clips&quot;, which can be triggered at any time, but that will play only at the
    right time, as authored in the corresponding JET file.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 As a result of the rendering and playback of the JET segments, the user of the JetPlayer instance
 can receive notifications from the JET engine relative to:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the playback state,&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the number of segments left to play in the queue,&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;application controller events (CC80-83) to mark points in the MIDI segments.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 Use {@link #getJetPlayer}() to construct a JetPlayer instance. JetPlayer is a singleton class.
 &lt;/p&gt;
