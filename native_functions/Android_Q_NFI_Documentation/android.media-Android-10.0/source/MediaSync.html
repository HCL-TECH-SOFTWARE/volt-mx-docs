 MediaSync class can be used to synchronously play audio and video streams.
 It can be used to play audio-only or video-only stream, too.

 &lt;p&gt;MediaSync is generally used like this:
 &lt;pre&gt;
 MediaSync sync = new MediaSync();
 sync.setSurface(surface);
 Surface inputSurface = sync.createInputSurface();
 ...
 // MediaCodec videoDecoder = ...;
 videoDecoder.configure(format, inputSurface, ...);
 ...
 sync.setAudioTrack(audioTrack);
 sync.setCallback(new MediaSync.Callback() {
     {@literal @Override}
     public void onAudioBufferConsumed(MediaSync sync, ByteBuffer audioBuffer, int bufferId) {
         ...
     }
 }, null);
 // This needs to be done since sync is paused on creation.
 sync.setPlaybackParams(new PlaybackParams().setSpeed(1.f));

 for (;;) {
   ...
   // send video frames to surface for rendering, e.g., call
   // videoDecoder.releaseOutputBuffer(videoOutputBufferIx, videoPresentationTimeNs);
   // More details are available as below.
   ...
   sync.queueAudio(audioByteBuffer, bufferId, audioPresentationTimeUs); // non-blocking.
   // The audioByteBuffer and bufferId will be returned via callback.
   // More details are available as below.
   ...
     ...
 }
 sync.setPlaybackParams(new PlaybackParams().setSpeed(0.f));
 sync.release();
 sync = null;

 // The following code snippet illustrates how video/audio raw frames are created by
 // MediaCodec's, how they are fed to MediaSync and how they are returned by MediaSync.
 // This is the callback from MediaCodec.
 onOutputBufferAvailable(MediaCodec codec, int bufferId, BufferInfo info) {
     // ...
     if (codec == videoDecoder) {
         // surface timestamp must contain media presentation time in nanoseconds.
         codec.releaseOutputBuffer(bufferId, 1000 * info.presentationTime);
     } else {
         ByteBuffer audioByteBuffer = codec.getOutputBuffer(bufferId);
         sync.queueAudio(audioByteBuffer, bufferId, info.presentationTime);
     }
     // ...
 }

 // This is the callback from MediaSync.
 onAudioBufferConsumed(MediaSync sync, ByteBuffer buffer, int bufferId) {
     // ...
     audioDecoder.releaseBuffer(bufferId, false);
     // ...
 }

 &lt;/pre&gt;

 The client needs to configure corresponding sink by setting the Surface and/or AudioTrack
 based on the stream type it will play.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For video, the client needs to call {@link #createInputSurface} to obtain a surface on
 which it will render video frames.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For audio, the client needs to set up audio track correctly, e.g., using {@link android.media.AudioTrack#MODE_STREAM}. The audio buffers are sent to MediaSync directly via {@link #queueAudio}, and are returned to the client via {@link android.media.MediaCodec.Callback#onAudioBufferConsumed}
 asynchronously. The client should not modify an audio buffer till it's returned.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The client can optionally pre-fill audio/video buffers by setting playback rate to 0.0,
 and then feed audio/video buffers to corresponding components. This can reduce possible
 initial underrun.
