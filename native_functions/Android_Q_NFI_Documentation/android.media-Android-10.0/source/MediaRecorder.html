 implements android.media.AudioRecordingMonitor

 implements android.media.AudioRecordingMonitorClient

 implements android.media.MicrophoneDirection

@extends java.lang.Object

 Used to record audio and video. The recording control is based on a
 simple state machine (see below).

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;{@docRoot}images/mediarecorder_state_diagram.gif&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; /&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A common case of using MediaRecorder to record audio works as follows:

 &lt;pre&gt;MediaRecorder recorder = new MediaRecorder();
 recorder.setAudioSource(MediaRecorder.AudioSource.MIC);
 recorder.setOutputFormat(MediaRecorder.OutputFormat.THREE_GPP);
 recorder.setAudioEncoder(MediaRecorder.AudioEncoder.AMR_NB);
 recorder.setOutputFile(PATH_NAME);
 recorder.prepare();
 recorder.start();   // Recording is now started
 ...
 recorder.stop();
 recorder.reset();   // You can reuse the object by going back to setAudioSource() step
 recorder.release(); // Now the object cannot be reused
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Applications may want to register for informational and error
 events in order to be informed of some internal update and possible
 runtime errors during recording. Registration for such events is
 done by setting the appropriate listeners (via calls
 (to {@link #setOnInfoListener}(OnInfoListener)setOnInfoListener and/or
 {@link #setOnErrorListener}(OnErrorListener)setOnErrorListener).
 In order to receive the respective callback associated with these listeners,
 applications are required to create MediaRecorder objects on threads with a
 Looper running (the main UI thread by default already has a Looper running).

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; Currently, MediaRecorder does not work on the emulator.
