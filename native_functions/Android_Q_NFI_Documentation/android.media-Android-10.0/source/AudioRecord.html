 The AudioRecord class manages the audio resources for Java applications
 to record audio from the audio input hardware of the platform. This is
 achieved by &quot;pulling&quot; (reading) the data from the AudioRecord object. The
 application is responsible for polling the AudioRecord object in time using one of
 the following three methods:  {@link #read(byte[],int, int)}, {@link #read(short[], int, int)}
 or {@link #read(ByteBuffer, int)}. The choice of which method to use will be based
 on the audio data storage format that is the most convenient for the user of AudioRecord.
 &lt;p&gt;Upon creation, an AudioRecord object initializes its associated audio buffer that it will
 fill with the new audio data. The size of this buffer, specified during the construction,
 determines how long an AudioRecord can record before &quot;over-running&quot; data that has not
 been read yet. Data should be read from the audio hardware in chunks of sizes inferior to
 the total recording buffer size.
