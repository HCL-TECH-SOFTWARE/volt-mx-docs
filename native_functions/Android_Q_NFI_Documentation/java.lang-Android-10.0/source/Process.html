 The {@link java.lang.ProcessBuilder#start()} and
 {@link java.lang.Runtime#exec(String[],String[],File) java.lang.Runtime.exec}
 methods create a native process and return an instance of a
 subclass of {@code Process} that can be used to control the process
 and obtain information about it.  The class {@code Process}
 provides methods for performing input from the process, performing
 output to the process, waiting for the process to complete,
 checking the exit status of the process, and destroying (killing)
 the process.

 &lt;p&gt;The methods that create processes may not work well for special
 processes on certain native platforms, such as native windowing
 processes, daemon processes, Win16/DOS processes on Microsoft
 Windows, or shell scripts.

 &lt;p&gt;By default, the created subprocess does not have its own terminal
 or console.  All its standard I/O (i.e. stdin, stdout, stderr)
 operations will be redirected to the parent process, where they can
 be accessed via the streams obtained using the methods
 {@link #getOutputStream}(),
 {@link #getInputStream}(), and
 {@link #getErrorStream}().
 The parent process uses these streams to feed input to and get output
 from the subprocess.  Because some native platforms only provide
 limited buffer size for standard input and output streams, failure
 to promptly write the input stream or read the output stream of
 the subprocess may cause the subprocess to block, or even deadlock.

 &lt;p&gt;Where desired, &lt;a href=&quot;ProcessBuilder.html#redirect-input&quot;&gt;
 subprocess I/O can also be redirected&lt;/a&gt;
 using methods of the {@link java.lang.ProcessBuilder} class.

 &lt;p&gt;The subprocess is not killed when there are no more references to
 the {@code Process} object, but rather the subprocess
 continues executing asynchronously.

 &lt;p&gt;There is no requirement that a process represented by a {@code
 Process} object execute asynchronously or concurrently with respect
 to the Java process that owns the {@code Process} object.

 &lt;p&gt;As of 1.5, {@link java.lang.ProcessBuilder#start()} is the preferred way
 to create a {@code Process}.
