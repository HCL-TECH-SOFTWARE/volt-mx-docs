 Every Java application has a single instance of class
 &lt;code&gt;Runtime&lt;/code&gt; that allows the application to interface with
 the environment in which the application is running. The current
 runtime can be obtained from the &lt;code&gt;getRuntime&lt;/code&gt; method.
 &lt;p&gt;
 An application cannot create its own instance of this class.

</span>
 &lt;p&gt; The Java virtual machine &lt;i&gt;shuts down&lt;/i&gt; in response to two kinds
 of events:

   &lt;ul&gt;

   &lt;li&gt; The program &lt;i&gt;exits&lt;/i&gt; normally, when the last non-daemon
   thread exits or when the &lt;tt&gt;{@link #exit exit}&lt;/tt&gt; (equivalently,
   {@link java.lang.System#exit(int) java.lang.System.exit}) method is invoked, or

   &lt;li&gt; The virtual machine is &lt;i&gt;terminated&lt;/i&gt; in response to a
   user interrupt, such as typing &lt;tt&gt;^C&lt;/tt&gt;, or a system-wide event,
   such as user logoff or system shutdown.

   &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; A &lt;i&gt;shutdown hook&lt;/i&gt; is simply an initialized but unstarted
 thread.  When the virtual machine begins its shutdown sequence it will
 start all registered shutdown hooks in some unspecified order and let
 them run concurrently.  When all the hooks have finished it will then
 run all uninvoked finalizers if finalization-on-exit has been enabled.
 Finally, the virtual machine will halt.  Note that daemon threads will
 continue to run during the shutdown sequence, as will non-daemon threads
 if shutdown was initiated by invoking the &lt;tt&gt;{@link #exit exit}&lt;/tt&gt;
 method.

 &lt;p&gt; Once the shutdown sequence has begun it can be stopped only by
 invoking the &lt;tt&gt;{@link #halt halt}&lt;/tt&gt; method, which forcibly
 terminates the virtual machine.

 &lt;p&gt; Once the shutdown sequence has begun it is impossible to register a
 new shutdown hook or de-register a previously-registered hook.
 Attempting either of these operations will cause an
 &lt;tt&gt;{@link java.lang.IllegalStateException}&lt;/tt&gt; to be thrown.

 &lt;p&gt; Shutdown hooks run at a delicate time in the life cycle of a virtual
 machine and should therefore be coded defensively.  They should, in
 particular, be written to be thread-safe and to avoid deadlocks insofar
 as possible.  They should also not rely blindly upon services that may
 have registered their own shutdown hooks and therefore may themselves in
 the process of shutting down.  Attempts to use other thread-based
 services such as the AWT event-dispatch thread, for example, may lead to
 deadlocks.

 &lt;p&gt; Shutdown hooks should also finish their work quickly.  When a
 program invokes &lt;tt&gt;{@link #exit exit}&lt;/tt&gt; the expectation is
 that the virtual machine will promptly shut down and exit.  When the
 virtual machine is terminated due to user logoff or system shutdown the
 underlying operating system may only allow a fixed amount of time in
 which to shut down and exit.  It is therefore inadvisable to attempt any
 user interaction or to perform a long-running computation in a shutdown
 hook.

 &lt;p&gt; Uncaught exceptions are handled in shutdown hooks just as in any
 other thread, by invoking the &lt;tt&gt;{@link java.lang.ThreadGroup#uncaughtException
 uncaughtException}&lt;/tt&gt; method of the thread's &lt;tt&gt;{@link java.lang.ThreadGroup}&lt;/tt&gt; object.  The default implementation of this method
 prints the exception's stack trace to &lt;tt&gt;{@link java.lang.System#err}&lt;/tt&gt; and
 terminates the thread; it does not cause the virtual machine to exit or
 halt.

 &lt;p&gt; In rare circumstances the virtual machine may &lt;i&gt;abort&lt;/i&gt;, that is,
 stop running without shutting down cleanly.  This occurs when the
 virtual machine is terminated externally, for example with the
 &lt;tt&gt;SIGKILL&lt;/tt&gt; signal on Unix or the &lt;tt&gt;TerminateProcess&lt;/tt&gt; call on
 Microsoft Windows.  The virtual machine may also abort if a native
 method goes awry by, for example, corrupting internal data structures or
 attempting to access nonexistent memory.  If the virtual machine aborts
 then no guarantee can be made about whether or not any shutdown hooks
 will be run. &lt;p&gt;
