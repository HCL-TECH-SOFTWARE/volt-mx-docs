 A thread group represents a set of threads. In addition, a thread
 group can also include other thread groups. The thread groups form
 a tree in which every thread group except the initial thread group
 has a parent.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A thread is allowed to access information about its own thread
 group, but not to access information about its thread group's
 parent thread group or any other thread groups.
