  <pre class="prettyprint lang-js"><span id='java-lang-AutoCloseable'>/**@class java.lang.AutoCloseable
</span> An object that may hold resources (such as file or socket handles)
 until it is closed. The {@link #close}() method of an {@code AutoCloseable}
 object is called automatically when exiting a {@code
 try}-with-resources block for which the object has been declared in
 the resource specification header. This construction ensures prompt
 release, avoiding resource exhaustion exceptions and errors that
 may otherwise occur.

 @apiNote
 &lt;p&gt;It is possible, and in fact common, for a base class to
 implement AutoCloseable even though not all of its subclasses or
 instances will hold releasable resources.  For code that must operate
 in complete generality, or when it is known that the {@code AutoCloseable}
 instance requires resource release, it is recommended to use {@code
 try}-with-resources constructions. However, when using facilities such as
 {@link java.util.stream.Stream} that support both I/O-based and
 non-I/O-based forms, {@code try}-with-resources blocks are in
 general unnecessary when using non-I/O-based forms.

var AutoCloseable = {

<span id='java-lang-AutoCloseable-method-close'>/**Closes this resource, relinquishing any underlying resources.
</span> This method is invoked automatically on objects managed by the
 {@code try}-with-resources statement.

 &lt;p&gt;While this interface method is declared to throw {@code
 Exception}, implementers are &lt;em&gt;strongly&lt;/em&gt; encouraged to
 declare concrete implementations of the {@code close} method to
 throw more specific exceptions, or to throw no exception at all
 if the close operation cannot fail.

 &lt;p&gt; Cases where the close operation may fail require careful
 attention by implementers. It is strongly advised to relinquish
 the underlying resources and to internally &lt;em&gt;mark&lt;/em&gt; the
 resource as closed, prior to throwing the exception. The {@code
 close} method is unlikely to be invoked more than once and so
 this ensures that the resources are released in a timely manner.
 Furthermore it reduces problems that could arise when the resource
 wraps, or is wrapped, by another resource.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Implementers of this interface are also strongly advised
 to not have the {@code close} method throw {@link java.lang.InterruptedException}.&lt;/em&gt;

 This exception interacts with a thread's interrupted status,
 and runtime misbehavior is likely to occur if an {@code
 InterruptedException} is {@linkplain java.lang.Throwable#addSuppressed
 suppressed}.

 More generally, if it would cause problems for an
 exception to be suppressed, the {@code AutoCloseable.close}
 method should not throw it.

 &lt;p&gt;Note that unlike the {@link java.io.Closeable#close close}
 method of {@link java.io.Closeable}, this {@code close} method
 is &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; required to be idempotent.  In other words,
 calling this {@code close} method more than once may have some
 visible side effect, unlike {@code Closeable.close} which is
 required to have no effect if called more than once.

 However, implementers of this interface are strongly encouraged
 to make their {@code close} methods idempotent.
@throws Exception if this resource cannot be closed
