</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 This class is used to create operating system processes.

 &lt;p&gt;Each {@code ProcessBuilder} instance manages a collection
 of process attributes.  The {@link #start}() method creates a new
 {@link java.lang.Process} instance with those attributes.  The {@link #start}() method can be invoked repeatedly from the same instance
 to create new subprocesses with identical or related attributes.

 &lt;p&gt;Each process builder manages these process attributes:

 &lt;ul&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;a &lt;i&gt;command&lt;/i&gt;, a list of strings which signifies the
 external program file to be invoked and its arguments, if any.
 Which string lists represent a valid operating system command is
 system-dependent.  For example, it is common for each conceptual
 argument to be an element in this list, but there are operating
 systems where programs are expected to tokenize command line
 strings themselves - on such a system a Java implementation might
 require commands to contain exactly two elements.

 &lt;li&gt;an &lt;i&gt;environment&lt;/i&gt;, which is a system-dependent mapping from
 &lt;i&gt;variables&lt;/i&gt; to &lt;i&gt;values&lt;/i&gt;.  The initial value is a copy of
 the environment of the current process (see {@link java.lang.System#getenv()}).

 &lt;li&gt;a &lt;i&gt;working directory&lt;/i&gt;.  The default value is the current
 working directory of the current process, usually the directory
 named by the system property {@code user.dir}.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;redirect-input&quot;&gt;a source of &lt;i&gt;standard input&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
 By default, the subprocess reads input from a pipe.  Java code
 can access this pipe via the output stream returned by
 {@link java.lang.Process#getOutputStream()}.  However, standard input may
 be redirected to another source using
 {@link #redirectInput(Redirect) redirectInput}.
 In this case, {@link java.lang.Process#getOutputStream()} will return a
 &lt;i&gt;null output stream&lt;/i&gt;, for which:

 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the {@link OutputStream#write(int) write} methods always
 throw {@code IOException}
 &lt;li&gt;the {@link OutputStream#close() close} method does nothing
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;redirect-output&quot;&gt;a destination for &lt;i&gt;standard output&lt;/i&gt;
 and &lt;i&gt;standard error&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.  By default, the subprocess writes standard
 output and standard error to pipes.  Java code can access these pipes
 via the input streams returned by {@link java.lang.Process#getInputStream()} and
 {@link java.lang.Process#getErrorStream()}.  However, standard output and
 standard error may be redirected to other destinations using
 {@link #redirectOutput(Redirect) redirectOutput} and
 {@link #redirectError(Redirect) redirectError}.
 In this case, {@link java.lang.Process#getInputStream()} and/or
 {@link java.lang.Process#getErrorStream()} will return a &lt;i&gt;null input
 stream&lt;/i&gt;, for which:

 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;the {@link InputStream#read() read} methods always return
 {@code -1}
 &lt;li&gt;the {@link InputStream#available() available} method always returns
 {@code 0}
 &lt;li&gt;the {@link InputStream#close() close} method does nothing
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;a &lt;i&gt;redirectErrorStream&lt;/i&gt; property.  Initially, this property
 is {@code false}, meaning that the standard output and error
 output of a subprocess are sent to two separate streams, which can
 be accessed using the {@link java.lang.Process#getInputStream()} and {@link java.lang.Process#getErrorStream()} methods.

 &lt;p&gt;If the value is set to {@code true}, then:

 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;standard error is merged with the standard output and always sent
 to the same destination (this makes it easier to correlate error
 messages with the corresponding output)
 &lt;li&gt;the common destination of standard error and standard output can be
 redirected using
 {@link #redirectOutput(Redirect) redirectOutput}
 &lt;li&gt;any redirection set by the
 {@link #redirectError(Redirect) redirectError}
 method is ignored when creating a subprocess
 &lt;li&gt;the stream returned from {@link java.lang.Process#getErrorStream()} will
 always be a &lt;a href=&quot;#redirect-output&quot;&gt;null input stream&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Modifying a process builder's attributes will affect processes
 subsequently started by that object's {@link #start}() method, but
 will never affect previously started processes or the Java process
 itself.

 &lt;p&gt;Most error checking is performed by the {@link #start}() method.
 It is possible to modify the state of an object so that {@link #start}() will fail.  For example, setting the command attribute to
 an empty list will not throw an exception unless {@link #start}()
 is invoked.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that this class is not synchronized.&lt;/strong&gt;
 If multiple threads access a {@code ProcessBuilder} instance
 concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies one of the
 attributes structurally, it &lt;i&gt;must&lt;/i&gt; be synchronized externally.

 &lt;p&gt;Starting a new process which uses the default working directory
 and environment is easy:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 Process p = new ProcessBuilder(&quot;myCommand&quot;, &quot;myArg&quot;).start();
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Here is an example that starts a process with a modified working
 directory and environment, and redirects standard output and error
 to be appended to a log file:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 ProcessBuilder pb =
   new ProcessBuilder(&quot;myCommand&quot;, &quot;myArg1&quot;, &quot;myArg2&quot;);
 Map&lt;String, String&gt; env = pb.environment();
 env.put(&quot;VAR1&quot;, &quot;myValue&quot;);
 env.remove(&quot;OTHERVAR&quot;);
 env.put(&quot;VAR2&quot;, env.get(&quot;VAR1&quot;) + &quot;suffix&quot;);
 pb.directory(new File(&quot;myDir&quot;));
 File log = new File(&quot;log&quot;);
 pb.redirectErrorStream(true);
 pb.redirectOutput(Redirect.appendTo(log));
 Process p = pb.start();
 assert pb.redirectInput() == Redirect.PIPE;
 assert pb.redirectOutput().file() == log;
 assert p.getInputStream().read() == -1;
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;To start a process with an explicit set of environment
 variables, first call {@link java.util.Map#clear() Map.clear()}
 before adding environment variables.

</span>
 Whenever a process builder is created, the environment is
 initialized to a copy of the current process environment (see
 {@link java.lang.System#getenv()}).  Subprocesses subsequently started by
 this object's {@link #start}() method will use this map as
 their environment.

 &lt;p&gt;The returned object may be modified using ordinary {@link java.util.Map Map} operations.  These modifications will be
 visible to subprocesses started via the {@link #start}()
 method.  Two {@code ProcessBuilder} instances always
 contain independent process environments, so changes to the
 returned map will never be reflected in any other
 {@code ProcessBuilder} instance or the values returned by
 {@link java.lang.System#getenv java.lang.System.getenv}.

 &lt;p&gt;If the system does not support environment variables, an
 empty map is returned.

 &lt;p&gt;The returned map does not permit null keys or values.
 Attempting to insert or query the presence of a null key or
 value will throw a {@link java.lang.NullPointerException}.
 Attempting to query the presence of a key or value which is not
 of type {@link java.lang.String} will throw a {@link java.lang.ClassCastException}.

 &lt;p&gt;The behavior of the returned map is system-dependent.  A
 system may not allow modifications to environment variables or
 may forbid certain variable names or values.  For this reason,
 attempts to modify the map may fail with
 {@link java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException} or
 {@link java.lang.IllegalArgumentException}
 if the modification is not permitted by the operating system.

 &lt;p&gt;Since the external format of environment variable names and
 values is system-dependent, there may not be a one-to-one
 mapping between them and Java's Unicode strings.  Nevertheless,
 the map is implemented in such a way that environment variables
 which are not modified by Java code will have an unmodified
 native representation in the subprocess.

 &lt;p&gt;The returned map and its collection views may not obey the
 general contract of the {@link java.lang.Object#equals} and
 {@link java.lang.Object#hashCode} methods.

 &lt;p&gt;The returned map is typically case-sensitive on all platforms.

 &lt;p&gt;If a security manager exists, its
 {@link java.lang.SecurityManager#checkPermission checkPermission} method
 is called with a
 {@link java.lang.RuntimePermission}{@code (&quot;getenv.*&quot;)} permission.
 This may result in a {@link java.lang.SecurityException} being thrown.

 &lt;p&gt;When passing information to a Java subprocess,
 &lt;a href=System.html#EnvironmentVSSystemProperties&gt;system properties&lt;/a&gt;
 are generally preferred over environment variables.
