 A &quot;PropertyChange&quot; event gets delivered whenever a bean changes a &quot;bound&quot;
 or &quot;constrained&quot; property.  A PropertyChangeEvent object is sent as an
 argument to the PropertyChangeListener and VetoableChangeListener methods.
 &lt;P&gt;
 Normally PropertyChangeEvents are accompanied by the name and the old
 and new value of the changed property.  If the new value is a primitive
 type (such as int or boolean) it must be wrapped as the
 corresponding java.lang.* Object type (such as Integer or Boolean).
 &lt;P&gt;
 Null values may be provided for the old and the new values if their
 true values are not known.
 &lt;P&gt;
 An event source may send a null object as the name to indicate that an
 arbitrary set of if its properties have changed.  In this case the
 old and new values should also be null.
