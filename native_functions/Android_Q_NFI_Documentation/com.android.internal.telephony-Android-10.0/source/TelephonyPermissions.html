 &lt;p&gt;This method behaves in one of the following ways:

   &lt;li&gt;return true: if the caller has the READ_PRIVILEGED_PHONE_STATE permission, the
       READ_PHONE_STATE runtime permission, or carrier privileges on the given subId.
   &lt;li&gt;throw SecurityException: if the caller didn't declare any of these permissions, or, for
       apps which support runtime permissions, if the caller does not currently have any of
       these permissions.
   &lt;li&gt;return false: if the caller lacks all of these permissions and doesn't support runtime
       permissions. This implies that the user revoked the ability to read phone state
       manually (via AppOps). In this case we can't throw as it would break app compatibility,
       so we return false to indicate that the calling function should return dummy data.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Note: for simplicity, this method always returns false for callers using legacy
 permissions and who have had READ_PHONE_STATE revoked, even if they are carrier-privileged.
 Such apps should migrate to runtime permissions or stop requiring READ_PHONE_STATE on P+
 devices.

              where it isn't relevant (hidden APIs, or APIs which are otherwise okay to leave
              inaccesible to carrier-privileged apps).
