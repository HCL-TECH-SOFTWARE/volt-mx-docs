</span> implements java.lang.Cloneable

@extends java.lang.Object

 This class holds a time/value pair for an animation. The Keyframe class is used
 by {@link android.animation.ValueAnimator} to define the values that the animation target will have over the course
 of the animation. As the time proceeds from one keyframe to the other, the value of the
 target object will animate between the value at the previous keyframe and the value at the
 next keyframe. Each keyframe also holds an optional {@link android.animation.TimeInterpolator}
 object, which defines the time interpolation over the intervalue preceding the keyframe.

 &lt;p&gt;The Keyframe class itself is abstract. The type-specific factory methods will return
 a subclass of Keyframe specific to the type of value being stored. This is done to improve
 performance when dealing with the most common cases (e.g., &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; and
 &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; values). Other types will fall into a more general Keyframe class that
 treats its values as Objects. Unless your animation requires dealing with a custom type
 or a data structure that needs to be animated directly (and evaluated using an implementation
 of {@link android.animation.TypeEvaluator}), you should stick to using float and int as animations using those
 types have lower runtime overhead than other types.&lt;/p&gt;
