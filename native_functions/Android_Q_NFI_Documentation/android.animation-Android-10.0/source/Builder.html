</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 The &lt;code&gt;Builder&lt;/code&gt; object is a utility class to facilitate adding animations to a
 &lt;code&gt;AnimatorSet&lt;/code&gt; along with the relationships between the various animations. The
 intention of the &lt;code&gt;Builder&lt;/code&gt; methods, along with the {@link android.animation.AnimatorSet#play(Animator) play()} method of &lt;code&gt;AnimatorSet&lt;/code&gt; is to make it possible
 to express the dependency relationships of animations in a natural way. Developers can also
 use the {@link android.animation.AnimatorSet#playTogether(Animator[]) playTogether()} and {@link android.animation.AnimatorSet#playSequentially(Animator[]) playSequentially()} methods if these suit the need,
 but it might be easier in some situations to express the AnimatorSet of animations in pairs.
 &lt;p/&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;Builder&lt;/code&gt; object cannot be constructed directly, but is rather constructed
 internally via a call to {@link android.animation.AnimatorSet#play(Animator)}.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p/&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;For example, this sets up a AnimatorSet to play anim1 and anim2 at the same time, anim3 to
 play when anim2 finishes, and anim4 to play when anim3 finishes:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;pre&gt;
     AnimatorSet s = new AnimatorSet();
     s.play(anim1).with(anim2);
     s.play(anim2).before(anim3);
     s.play(anim4).after(anim3);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;p/&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Note in the example that both {@link android.animation.AnimatorSet.Builder#before(Animator)} and {@link android.animation.AnimatorSet.Builder#after(Animator)} are used. These are just different ways of expressing the same
 relationship and are provided to make it easier to say things in a way that is more natural,
 depending on the situation.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p/&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;It is possible to make several calls into the same &lt;code&gt;Builder&lt;/code&gt; object to express
 multiple relationships. However, note that it is only the animation passed into the initial
 {@link android.animation.AnimatorSet#play(Animator)} method that is the dependency in any of the successive
 calls to the &lt;code&gt;Builder&lt;/code&gt; object. For example, the following code starts both anim2
 and anim3 when anim1 ends; there is no direct dependency relationship between anim2 and
 anim3:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   AnimatorSet s = new AnimatorSet();
   s.play(anim1).before(anim2).before(anim3);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 If the desired result is to play anim1 then anim2 then anim3, this code expresses the
 relationship correctly:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;pre&gt;
   AnimatorSet s = new AnimatorSet();
   s.play(anim1).before(anim2);
   s.play(anim2).before(anim3);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;p/&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Note that it is possible to express relationships that cannot be resolved and will not
 result in sensible results. For example, &lt;code&gt;play(anim1).after(anim1)&lt;/code&gt; makes no
 sense. In general, circular dependencies like this one (or more indirect ones where a depends
 on b, which depends on c, which depends on a) should be avoided. Only create AnimatorSets
 that can boil down to a simple, one-way relationship of animations starting with, before, and
 after other, different, animations.&lt;/p&gt;
