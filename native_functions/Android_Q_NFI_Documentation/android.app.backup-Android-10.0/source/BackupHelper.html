</span> Defines the calling interface that {@link android.app.backup.BackupAgentHelper} uses
 when dispatching backup and restore operations to the installed helpers.
 Applications can define and install their own helpers as well as using those
 provided as part of the Android framework.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Although multiple helper objects may be installed simultaneously, each helper
 is responsible only for handling its own data, and will not see entities
 created by other components within the backup system.  Invocations of multiple
 helpers are performed sequentially by the {@link android.app.backup.BackupAgentHelper}, with each
 helper given a chance to access its own saved state from within the state record
 produced during the previous backup operation.

</span> needs to be backed up, write it to &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;, and fill in
 &lt;code&gt;newState&lt;/code&gt; with the complete state as it exists now.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Implementing this method is much like implementing
 {@link android.app.backup.BackupAgent#onBackup(ParcelFileDescriptor, BackupDataOutput, ParcelFileDescriptor)
 onBackup()} &amp;mdash; the method parameters are the same.  When this method is invoked the
 {@code oldState} descriptor points to the beginning of the state data
 written during this helper's previous backup operation, and the {@code newState}
 descriptor points to the file location at which the helper should write its
 new state after performing the backup operation.
 &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; The helper should not close or seek either the {@code oldState} or
 the {@code newState} file descriptors.  It is essential that when reading the helper's
 saved state from the {@code oldState} file, no extra content is consumed beyond
 what was stored by this helper.  If more old state data is read, even accidentally,
 it will make it impossible for additional helpers that may be invoked after this one
 to properly reconstruct their prior state.&lt;/p&gt;
@param {Object {ParcelFileDescriptor}} oldState An open, read-only {@link android.os.ParcelFileDescriptor} pointing to the
            last backup state provided by the application. May be
            &lt;code&gt;null&lt;/code&gt;, in which case no prior state is being
            provided and the application should perform a full backup.
@param {Object {BackupDataOutput}} data An open, read/write {@link BackupDataOutput}
            pointing to the backup data destination.
            Typically the application will use backup helper classes to
            write to this file.
@param {Object {ParcelFileDescriptor}} newState An open, read/write {@link android.os.ParcelFileDescriptor} pointing to an
            empty file. The application should record the final backup
            state here after writing the requested data to the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;
            output stream.
