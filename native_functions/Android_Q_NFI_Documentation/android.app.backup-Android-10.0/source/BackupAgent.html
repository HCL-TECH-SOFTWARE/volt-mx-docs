</span>@extends android.content.ContextWrapper

 Provides the central interface between an
 application and Android's data backup infrastructure.  An application that wishes
 to participate in the backup and restore mechanism will declare a subclass of
 {@link android.app.backup.BackupAgent}, implement the
 {@link #onBackup(ParcelFileDescriptor, android.app.backup.BackupDataOutput, ParcelFileDescriptor) onBackup()}
 and {@link #onRestore(BackupDataInput, int, ParcelFileDescriptor) onRestore()} methods,
 and provide the name of its backup agent class in its {@code AndroidManifest.xml} file via
 the &lt;code&gt;
 &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;application&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
 tag's {@code android:backupAgent} attribute.

 &lt;div class=&quot;special reference&quot;&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Developer Guides&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;For more information about using BackupAgent, read the
 &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}guide/topics/data/backup.html&quot;&gt;Data Backup&lt;/a&gt; developer guide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;Basic Operation&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 When the application makes changes to data that it wishes to keep backed up,
 it should call the
 {@link android.app.backup.BackupManager#dataChanged() BackupManager.dataChanged()} method.
 This notifies the Android Backup Manager that the application needs an opportunity
 to update its backup image.  The Backup Manager, in turn, schedules a
 backup pass to be performed at an opportune time.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Restore operations are typically performed only when applications are first
 installed on a device.  At that time, the operating system checks to see whether
 there is a previously-saved data set available for the application being installed, and if so,
 begins an immediate restore pass to deliver the backup data as part of the installation
 process.
 &lt;p&gt;
 When a backup or restore pass is run, the application's process is launched
 (if not already running), the manifest-declared backup agent class (in the {@code
 android:backupAgent} attribute) is instantiated within
 that process, and the agent's {@link #onCreate}() method is invoked.  This prepares the
 agent instance to run the actual backup or restore logic.  At this point the
 agent's
 {@link #onBackup(ParcelFileDescriptor, android.app.backup.BackupDataOutput, ParcelFileDescriptor) onBackup()} or
 {@link #onRestore(BackupDataInput, int, ParcelFileDescriptor) onRestore()} method will be
 invoked as appropriate for the operation being performed.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A backup data set consists of one or more &quot;entities,&quot; flattened binary data
 records that are each identified with a key string unique within the data set.  Adding a
 record to the active data set or updating an existing record is done by simply
 writing new entity data under the desired key.  Deleting an entity from the data set
 is done by writing an entity under that key with header specifying a negative data
 size, and no actual entity data.
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Helper Classes&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 An extensible agent based on convenient helper classes is available in
 {@link android.app.backup.BackupAgentHelper}.  That class is particularly
 suited to handling of simple file or {@link android.content.SharedPreferences}
 backup and restore.
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Threading&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The constructor, as well as {@link #onCreate}() and {@link #onDestroy}() lifecycle callbacks run
 on the main thread (UI thread) of the application that implements the BackupAgent.
 The data-handling callbacks:
 {@link #onBackup(ParcelFileDescriptor, android.app.backup.BackupDataOutput, ParcelFileDescriptor) onBackup()},
 {@link #onFullBackup}(FullBackupDataOutput),
 {@link #onRestore(BackupDataInput, int, ParcelFileDescriptor) onRestore()},
 {@link #onRestoreFile(ParcelFileDescriptor, long, File, int, long, long) onRestoreFile()},
 {@link #onRestoreFinished}(), and {@link #onQuotaExceeded(long, long) onQuotaExceeded()}
 run on binder pool threads.
