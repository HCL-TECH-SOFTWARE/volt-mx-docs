</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 The interface through which an application interacts with the Android backup service to
 request backup and restore operations.
 Applications instantiate it using the constructor and issue calls through that instance.
 &lt;p&gt;
 When an application has made changes to data which should be backed up, a
 call to {@link #dataChanged}() will notify the backup service. The system
 will then schedule a backup operation to occur in the near future. Repeated
 calls to {@link #dataChanged}() have no further effect until the backup
 operation actually occurs.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A backup or restore operation for your application begins when the system launches the
 {@link android.app.backup.BackupAgent} subclass you've declared in your manifest. See the
 documentation for {@link android.app.backup.BackupAgent} for a detailed description
 of how the operation then proceeds.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Several attributes affecting the operation of the backup and restore mechanism
 can be set on the &lt;code&gt;
 &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}guide/topics/manifest/application-element.html&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;application&amp;gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
 tag in your application's AndroidManifest.xml file.

 &lt;div class=&quot;special reference&quot;&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Developer Guides&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;For more information about using BackupManager, read the
 &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}guide/topics/data/backup.html&quot;&gt;Data Backup&lt;/a&gt; developer guide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
