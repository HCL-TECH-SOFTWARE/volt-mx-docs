 of weaknesses due to which ciphertext may leak information about plaintext. For example,
 if a given plaintext always produces the same ciphertext, an attacker may see the
 repeated ciphertexts and be able to deduce something about the plaintext.

 &lt;p&gt;By default, {@code IND-CPA} is required.

 &lt;p&gt;Before disabling this requirement, consider the following approaches instead:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If you are generating a random IV for encryption and then initializing a {@code}
 Cipher using the IV, the solution is to let the {@code Cipher} generate a random IV
 instead. This will occur if the {@code Cipher} is initialized for encryption without an
 IV. The IV can then be queried via {@link Cipher#getIV()}.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If you are generating a non-random IV (e.g., an IV derived from something not fully
 random, such as the name of the file being encrypted, or transaction ID, or password,
 or a device identifier), consider changing your design to use a random IV which will then
 be provided in addition to the ciphertext to the entities which need to decrypt the
 ciphertext.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If you are using RSA encryption without padding, consider switching to padding
 schemes which offer {@code IND-CPA}, such as PKCS#1 or OAEP.&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;By default, the key is authorized to be used regardless of whether the user has been
 authenticated.

 &lt;p&gt;When user authentication is required:

 disabled (reconfigured to None, Swipe or other mode which does not authenticate the user)
 or when the secure lock screen is forcibly reset (e.g., by a Device Administrator).
 Additionally, if the key requires that user authentication takes place for every use of
 the key, it is also irreversibly invalidated once a new biometric is enrolled or once\
 no more biometrics are enrolled, unless {@link #setInvalidatedByBiometricEnrollment}(boolean) is used to allow validity after
 enrollment. Attempts to initialize cryptographic operations using such keys will throw

 &lt;p&gt;Cryptographic operations involving keys which require user authentication to take

 initializing a cryptographic operation ({@link Signature}, {@link Cipher}, {@link Mac})
 with the key, wrapping it into a {@link BiometricPrompt.CryptoObject}, invoking
 {@code BiometricPrompt.authenticate} with {@code CryptoObject}, and proceeding with
 the cryptographic operation only if the authentication flow succeeds.

 &lt;p&gt;Cryptographic operations involving keys which are authorized to be used for a duration
 of time after a successful user authentication event can only use secure lock screen
 authentication. These cryptographic operations will throw
 {@link android.security.keystore.UserNotAuthenticatedException} during initialization if the user needs to be
 authenticated to proceed. This situation can be resolved by the user unlocking the secure
 lock screen of the Android or by going through the confirm credential flow initiated by
