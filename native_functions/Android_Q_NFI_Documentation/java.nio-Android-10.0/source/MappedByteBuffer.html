</span>@extends java.nio.ByteBuffer

 A direct byte buffer whose content is a memory-mapped region of a file.

 &lt;p&gt; Mapped byte buffers are created via the {@link java.nio.channels.FileChannel#map FileChannel.map} method.  This class
 extends the {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer} class with operations that are specific to
 memory-mapped file regions.

 &lt;p&gt; A mapped byte buffer and the file mapping that it represents remain
 valid until the buffer itself is garbage-collected.

 &lt;p&gt; The content of a mapped byte buffer can change at any time, for example
 if the content of the corresponding region of the mapped file is changed by
 this program or another.  Whether or not such changes occur, and when they
 occur, is operating-system dependent and therefore unspecified.

 &lt;a name=&quot;inaccess&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;p&gt; All or part of a mapped byte buffer may become
 inaccessible at any time, for example if the mapped file is truncated.  An
 attempt to access an inaccessible region of a mapped byte buffer will not
 change the buffer's content and will cause an unspecified exception to be
 thrown either at the time of the access or at some later time.  It is
 therefore strongly recommended that appropriate precautions be taken to
 avoid the manipulation of a mapped file by this program, or by a
 concurrently running program, except to read or write the file's content.

 &lt;p&gt; Mapped byte buffers otherwise behave no differently than ordinary direct
 byte buffers. &lt;/p&gt;
