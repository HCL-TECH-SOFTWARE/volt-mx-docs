</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 The interface through which a time zone update application interacts with the Android system
 to handle time zone rule updates.

 &lt;p&gt;This interface is intended for use with the default APK-based time zone rules update
 application but it can also be used by OEMs if that mechanism is turned off using configuration.
 All callers must possess the {@link android.Manifest.permission#UPDATE_TIME_ZONE_RULES} system
 permission unless otherwise stated.

 &lt;p&gt;When using the default mechanism, when properly configured the Android system will send a
 {@link android.app.timezone.RulesUpdaterContract#ACTION_TRIGGER_RULES_UPDATE_CHECK} intent with a
 {@link android.app.timezone.RulesUpdaterContract#EXTRA_CHECK_TOKEN} extra to the time zone rules updater application
 when it detects that it or the OEM's APK containing time zone rules data has been modified. The
 updater application is then responsible for calling one of
 {@link #requestInstall(ParcelFileDescriptor, byte[], android.app.timezone.Callback)},
 {@link #requestUninstall(byte[], android.app.timezone.Callback)} or
 {@link #requestNothing(byte[], boolean)}, indicating, respectively, whether a new time zone rules
 distro should be installed, the current distro should be uninstalled, or there is nothing to do
 (or that the correct operation could not be determined due to an error). In each case the updater
 must pass the {@link android.app.timezone.RulesUpdaterContract#EXTRA_CHECK_TOKEN} value it received from the intent
 back so the system in the {@code checkToken} parameter.

 &lt;p&gt;If OEMs want to handle their own time zone rules updates, perhaps via a server-side component
 rather than an APK, then they should disable the default triggering mechanism in config and are
 responsible for triggering their own update checks / installs / uninstalls. In this case the
 &quot;check token&quot; parameter can be left null and there is never any need to call
 {@link #requestNothing(byte[], boolean)}.

 &lt;p&gt;OEMs should not mix the default mechanism and their own as this could lead to conflicts and
 unnecessary checks being triggered.

 &lt;p&gt;Applications obtain this using {@link android.app.Activity#getSystemService(String)} with
 {@link Context#TIME_ZONE_RULES_MANAGER_SERVICE}.
