</span> one that has number 0). The obtained object is an instance of the Channel class.
 If the AID is null, it means no Applet is to be selected on this channel and the default
 Applet is used. If the AID is defined then the corresponding Applet is selected.
 Once this channel has been opened by a device application, it is considered as &quot;locked&quot;
 by this device application, and other calls to this method will return null, until the
 channel is closed. Some Secure Elements (like the UICC) might always keep the basic channel
 locked (i.e. return null to applications), to prevent access to the basic channel, while
 some other might return a channel object implementing some kind of filtering on the
 commands, restricting the set of accepted command to a smaller set.
 It is recommended for the UICC to reject the opening of the basic channel to a specific
 applet, by always answering null to such a request.
 For other Secure Elements, the recommendation is to accept opening the basic channel
 on the default applet until another applet is selected on the basic channel. As there is no
 other way than a reset to select again the default applet, the implementation of the
 transport API should guarantee that the openBasicChannel(null) command will return
 null until a reset occurs.
 With previous release (V2.05) it was not possible to set P2 value, this value was always
 set to '00'.Except for specific needs it is recommended to keep P2 to '00'. It is
 recommended that the device allows all values for P2, however only the following values
 are mandatory: '00', '04', '08', '0C'(as defined in [2])
 The implementation of the underlying SELECT command within this method shall be
 based on ISO 7816-4 with following options:

 Secure Element was able to open a channel (e.g. status word '90 00' or status words
 referencing a warning in ISO-7816-4: '62 XX' or '63 XX') the API shall keep the
 channel opened and the next getSelectResponse() shall return the received status
 word.
 Other received status codes indicating that the Secure Element was able not to open a
 channel shall be considered as an error and the corresponding channel shall not be
 opened.
 The function without P2 as parameter is provided for backwards compatibility and will
 fall back to a select command with P2='00'.
