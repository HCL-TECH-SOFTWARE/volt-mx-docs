 Instances of this class represent an ISO/IEC 7816-4 channel opened to a

 calling the Session.openBasicChannel(byte[]) or
 Session.openLogicalChannel(byte[]) methods.

</span> underlying layers generate as many TPDUs as necessary to transport this APDU. The
 API shall ensure that all available data returned from Secure Element, including
 concatenated responses, are retrieved and made available to the calling application. If a
 warning status code is received the API wont check for further response data but will
 return all data received so far and the warning status code.&lt;br&gt;
 The transport part is invisible from the application. The generated response is the
 response of the APDU which means that all protocols related responses are handled
 inside the API or the underlying implementation.&lt;br&gt;
 The transmit method shall support extended length APDU commands independently of
 the coding within the ATR.&lt;br&gt;
 For status word '61 XX' the API or underlying implementation shall issue a GET
 RESPONSE command as specified by ISO 7816-4 standard with LE=XX; for the status
 word '6C XX', the API or underlying implementation shall reissue the input command
 with LE=XX. For other status words, the API (or underlying implementation) shall return
 the complete response including data and status word to the device application. The API
 (or underlying implementation) shall not handle internally the received status words. The
 channel shall not be closed even if the Secure Element answered with an error code.
 The system ensures the synchronization between all the concurrent calls to this method,
 and that only one APDU will be sent at a time, irrespective of the number of TPDUs that
 might be required to transport it to the SE. The entire APDU communication to this SE is
 locked to the APDU.&lt;br&gt;
 The channel information in the class byte in the APDU will be ignored. The system will
 add any required information to ensure the APDU is transported on this channel.
 The only restrictions on the set of commands that can be sent is defined below, the API
 implementation shall be able to send all other commands: &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;MANAGE_CHANNEL commands are not allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;SELECT by DF Name (p1=04) are not allowed.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;CLA bytes with channel numbers are de-masked.&lt;/li&gt;

@param {Object {byte[]}} command the APDU command to be transmitted, as a byte array.
@return {Number} the response received, as a byte array. The returned byte array contains the data
 bytes in the following order:
 [&amp;lt;first data byte&amp;gt;, ..., &amp;lt;last data byte&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;sw1&amp;gt;, &amp;lt;sw2&amp;gt;]
@throws IOException if there is a communication problem to the reader or the Secure Element.
@throws IllegalStateException if the channel is used after being closed.
@throws IllegalArgumentException if the command byte array is less than 4 bytes long.
@throws IllegalArgumentException if Lc byte is inconsistent with length of the byte array.
@throws IllegalArgumentException if CLA byte is invalid according to [2] (0xff).
@throws IllegalArgumentException if INS byte is invalid according to [2] (0x6x or 0x9x).
