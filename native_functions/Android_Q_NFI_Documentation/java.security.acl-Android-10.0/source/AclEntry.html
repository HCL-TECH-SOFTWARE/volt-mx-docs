</span> implements java.lang.Cloneable

 This is the interface used for representing one entry in an Access
 Control List (ACL).&lt;p&gt;

 An ACL can be thought of as a data structure with multiple ACL entry
 objects. Each ACL entry object contains a set of permissions associated
 with a particular principal. (A principal represents an entity such as
 an individual user or a group). Additionally, each ACL entry is specified
 as being either positive or negative. If positive, the permissions are
 to be granted to the associated principal. If negative, the permissions
 are to be denied. Each principal can have at most one positive ACL entry
 and one negative entry; that is, multiple positive or negative ACL
 entries are not allowed for any principal.

 Note: ACL entries are by default positive. An entry becomes a
 negative entry only if the
 {@link #setNegativePermissions() setNegativePermissions}
 method is called on it.
