@extends java.lang.Enum

 A month-of-year, such as 'July'.
 &lt;p&gt;
 {@code Month} is an enum representing the 12 months of the year -
 January, February, March, April, May, June, July, August, September, October,
 November and December.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In addition to the textual enum name, each month-of-year has an {@code int} value.
 The {@code int} value follows normal usage and the ISO-8601 standard,
 from 1 (January) to 12 (December). It is recommended that applications use the enum
 rather than the {@code int} value to ensure code clarity.
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Do not use {@code ordinal()} to obtain the numeric representation of {@code Month}.
 Use {@code getValue()} instead.&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 This enum represents a common concept that is found in many calendar systems.
 As such, this enum may be used by any calendar system that has the month-of-year
 concept defined exactly equivalent to the ISO-8601 calendar system.

 @implSpec
 This is an immutable and thread-safe enum.

 @since 1.8
