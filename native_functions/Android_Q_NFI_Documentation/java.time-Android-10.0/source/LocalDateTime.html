 A date-time without a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 such as {@code 2007-12-03T10:15:30}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 {@code LocalDateTime} is an immutable date-time object that represents a date-time,
 often viewed as year-month-day-hour-minute-second. Other date and time fields,
 such as day-of-year, day-of-week and week-of-year, can also be accessed.
 Time is represented to nanosecond precision.
 For example, the value &quot;2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789&quot; can be
 stored in a {@code LocalDateTime}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This class does not store or represent a time-zone.
 Instead, it is a description of the date, as used for birthdays, combined with
 the local time as seen on a wall clock.
 It cannot represent an instant on the time-line without additional information
 such as an offset or time-zone.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
 system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
 For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
 However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
 to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.

 @implSpec
 This class is immutable and thread-safe.

 This returns a {@code LocalDateTime}, based on this one, with the date-time adjusted.
 The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
 Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
 A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A selection of common adjustments is provided in
 {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters TemporalAdjusters}.
 These include finding the &quot;last day of the month&quot; and &quot;next Wednesday&quot;.
 Key date-time classes also implement the {@code TemporalAdjuster} interface,
 such as {@link java.time.Month} and {@link java.time.MonthDay MonthDay}.
 The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
 lengths of month and leap years.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:
 &lt;pre&gt;
  import static java.time.Month.*;
  import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

  result = localDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The classes {@link java.time.LocalDate} and {@link java.time.LocalTime} implement {@code TemporalAdjuster},
 thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:
 &lt;pre&gt;
  result = localDateTime.with(date);
  result = localDateTime.with(time);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
 {@link TemporalAdjuster#adjustInto(Temporal)} method on the
 specified adjuster passing {@code this} as the argument.

 This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This returns a {@code LocalDateTime}, based on this one, with the value
 for the specified field changed.
 This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
 If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
 some other reason, an exception is thrown.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
 such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
 In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
 the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If the field is a {@link ChronoField} then the adjustment is implemented here.
 The {@link #isSupported(TemporalField) supported fields} will behave as per
 the matching method on {@link java.time.LocalDate#with(TemporalField, long) java.time.LocalDate}
 or {@link java.time.LocalTime#with(TemporalField, long) java.time.LocalTime}.
 All other {@code ChronoField} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.

</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input

 The adjustment is equivalent to using {@link Temporal#with(TemporalField, long)}
 twice, passing {@link ChronoField#EPOCH_DAY} and
 {@link ChronoField#NANO_OF_DAY} as the fields.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using

   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
   temporal = thisLocalDateTime.adjustInto(temporal);

<span id='java-time-LocalDateTime-method-until'>/**Calculates the amount of time until another date-time in terms of the specified unit.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This calculates the amount of time between two {@code LocalDateTime}
 objects in terms of a single {@code TemporalUnit}.
 The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified date-time.
 The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
 The {@code Temporal} passed to this method is converted to a
 {@code LocalDateTime} using {@link #from}(TemporalAccessor).
 For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
 using {@code startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS)}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
 complete units between the two date-times.
 For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00 and 2012-08-14T23:59
 will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 The first is to invoke this method.
 The second is to use {@link TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent
   amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
   amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation is implemented in this method for {@link ChronoUnit}.
 The units {@code NANOS}, {@code MICROS}, {@code MILLIS}, {@code SECONDS},
 {@code MINUTES}, {@code HOURS} and {@code HALF_DAYS}, {@code DAYS},
 {@code WEEKS}, {@code MONTHS}, {@code YEARS}, {@code DECADES},
 {@code CENTURIES}, {@code MILLENNIA} and {@code ERAS} are supported.
 Other {@code ChronoUnit} values will throw an exception.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
 is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
 passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal
 as the second argument.

</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This returns a {@code ZonedDateTime} formed from this date-time at the
 specified time-zone. The result will match this date-time as closely as possible.
 Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every local date-time
 is valid for the specified zone, thus the local date-time may be adjusted.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The local date-time is resolved to a single instant on the time-line.
 This is achieved by finding a valid offset from UTC/Greenwich for the local
 date-time as defined by the {@link ZoneRules rules} of the zone ID.
&lt;p&gt;
 In most cases, there is only one valid offset for a local date-time.
 In the case of an overlap, where clocks are set back, there are two valid offsets.
 This method uses the earlier offset typically corresponding to &quot;summer&quot;.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In the case of a gap, where clocks jump forward, there is no valid offset.
 Instead, the local date-time is adjusted to be later by the length of the gap.
 For a typical one hour daylight savings change, the local date-time will be
 moved one hour later into the offset typically corresponding to &quot;summer&quot;.
 &lt;p&gt;
 To obtain the later offset during an overlap, call
 {@link java.time.ZonedDateTime#withLaterOffsetAtOverlap()} on the result of this method.
 To throw an exception when there is a gap or overlap, use
 {@link ZonedDateTime#ofStrict(LocalDateTime, ZoneOffset, java.time.ZoneId)}.
