 A date-time with an offset from UTC/Greenwich in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 such as {@code 2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 {@code OffsetDateTime} is an immutable representation of a date-time with an offset.
 This class stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
 as well as the offset from UTC/Greenwich. For example, the value
 &quot;2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789 +02:00&quot; can be stored in an {@code OffsetDateTime}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 {@code OffsetDateTime}, {@link java.time.ZonedDateTime} and {@link java.time.Instant} all store an instant
 on the time-line to nanosecond precision.
 {@code Instant} is the simplest, simply representing the instant.
 {@code OffsetDateTime} adds to the instant the offset from UTC/Greenwich, which allows
 the local date-time to be obtained.
 {@code ZonedDateTime} adds full time-zone rules.
 &lt;p&gt;
 It is intended that {@code ZonedDateTime} or {@code Instant} is used to model data
 in simpler applications. This class may be used when modeling date-time concepts in
 more detail, or when communicating to a database or in a network protocol.

 @implSpec
 This class is immutable and thread-safe.

 A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
 A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
 A selection of common adjustments is provided in
 {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters TemporalAdjusters}.
 These include finding the &quot;last day of the month&quot; and &quot;next Wednesday&quot;.
 Key date-time classes also implement the {@code TemporalAdjuster} interface,
 such as {@link java.time.Month} and {@link java.time.MonthDay MonthDay}.
 The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
 lengths of month and leap years.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:
 &lt;pre&gt;
  import static java.time.Month.*;
  import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

  result = offsetDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The classes {@link java.time.LocalDate}, {@link java.time.LocalTime} and {@link java.time.ZoneOffset} implement
 {@code TemporalAdjuster}, thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:
 &lt;pre&gt;
  result = offsetDateTime.with(date);
  result = offsetDateTime.with(time);
  result = offsetDateTime.with(offset);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
 {@link TemporalAdjuster#adjustInto(Temporal)} method on the
 specified adjuster passing {@code this} as the argument.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

@return {Object {java.time.OffsetDateTime}} an {@code OffsetDateTime} based on {@code this} with the adjustment made, not null

with : function(  ) {},

<span id='java-time-OffsetDateTime-method-with'>/**Returns a copy of this date-time with the specified field set to a new value.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This returns an {@code OffsetDateTime}, based on this one, with the value
 for the specified field changed.
 This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
 If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
 some other reason, an exception is thrown.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
 such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
 In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
 the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If the field is a {@link ChronoField} then the adjustment is implemented here.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@code INSTANT_SECONDS} field will return a date-time with the specified instant.
 The offset and nano-of-second are unchanged.
 If the new instant value is outside the valid range then a {@code DateTimeException} will be thrown.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@code OFFSET_SECONDS} field will return a date-time with the specified offset.
 The local date-time is unaltered. If the new offset value is outside the valid range
 then a {@code DateTimeException} will be thrown.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The other {@link #isSupported(TemporalField) supported fields} will behave as per
 the matching method on {@link java.time.LocalDateTime#with(TemporalField, long) java.time.LocalDateTime}.
 In this case, the offset is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.
 &lt;p&gt;
 All other {@code ChronoField} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method
 is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalField.adjustInto(Temporal, long)}
 passing {@code this} as the argument. In this case, the field determines
 whether and how to adjust the instant.

<span id='java-time-OffsetDateTime-method-adjustInto'>/**Adjusts the specified temporal object to have the same offset, date
</span> and time as this object.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input
 with the offset, date and time changed to be the same as this.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The adjustment is equivalent to using {@link Temporal#with(TemporalField, long)}
 three times, passing {@link ChronoField#EPOCH_DAY},
 {@link ChronoField#NANO_OF_DAY} and {@link ChronoField#OFFSET_SECONDS} as the fields.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using
 {@link Temporal#with(TemporalAdjuster)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
   temporal = thisOffsetDateTime.adjustInto(temporal);
   temporal = temporal.with(thisOffsetDateTime);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

<span id='java-time-OffsetDateTime-method-until'>/**Calculates the amount of time until another date-time in terms of the specified unit.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This calculates the amount of time between two {@code OffsetDateTime}
 objects in terms of a single {@code TemporalUnit}.
 The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified date-time.
 The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
 For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
 using {@code startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS)}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@code Temporal} passed to this method is converted to a
 {@code OffsetDateTime} using {@link #from}(TemporalAccessor).
 If the offset differs between the two date-times, the specified
 end date-time is normalized to have the same offset as this date-time.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
 complete units between the two date-times.
 For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00Z and 2012-08-14T23:59Z
 will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 The first is to invoke this method.
 The second is to use {@link TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent
   amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
   amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation is implemented in this method for {@link ChronoUnit}.
 The units {@code NANOS}, {@code MICROS}, {@code MILLIS}, {@code SECONDS},
 {@code MINUTES}, {@code HOURS} and {@code HALF_DAYS}, {@code DAYS},
 {@code WEEKS}, {@code MONTHS}, {@code YEARS}, {@code DECADES},
 {@code CENTURIES}, {@code MILLENNIA} and {@code ERAS} are supported.
 Other {@code ChronoUnit} values will throw an exception.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
 is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
 passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal
 as the second argument.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
@param {Object {Temporal}} endExclusive  the end date, exclusive, which is converted to an {@code OffsetDateTime}, not null
@param {Object {TemporalUnit}} unit  the unit to measure the amount in, not null

@throws DateTimeException if the amount cannot be calculated, or the end

 Where possible, the result will have the same local date-time as this object.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Time-zone rules, such as daylight savings, mean that not every time on the
 local time-line exists. If the local date-time is in a gap or overlap according to
 the rules then a resolver is used to determine the resultant local time and offset.
 This method uses {@link ZonedDateTime#ofLocal(LocalDateTime, java.time.ZoneId, ZoneOffset)}
