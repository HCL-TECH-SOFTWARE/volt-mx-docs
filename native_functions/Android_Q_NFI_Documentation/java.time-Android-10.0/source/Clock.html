</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A clock providing access to the current instant, date and time using a time-zone.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Instances of this class are used to find the current instant, which can be
 interpreted using the stored time-zone to find the current date and time.
 As such, a clock can be used instead of {@link System#currentTimeMillis()}
 and {@link TimeZone#getDefault()}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Use of a {@code Clock} is optional. All key date-time classes also have a
 {@code now()} factory method that uses the system clock in the default time zone.
 The primary purpose of this abstraction is to allow alternate clocks to be
 plugged in as and when required. Applications use an object to obtain the
 current time rather than a static method. This can simplify testing.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Best practice for applications is to pass a {@code Clock} into any method
 that requires the current instant. A dependency injection framework is one
 way to achieve this:
 &lt;pre&gt;
  public class MyBean {
    private Clock clock;  // dependency inject
    ...
    public void process(LocalDate eventDate) {
      if (eventDate.isBefore(LocalDate.now(clock)) {
        ...
      }
    }
  }
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 This approach allows an alternate clock, such as {@link #fixed(Instant, java.time.ZoneId) fixed}
 or {@link #offset(Clock, java.time.Duration) offset} to be used during testing.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@code system} factory methods provide clocks based on the best available
 system clock This may use {@link System#currentTimeMillis()}, or a higher
 resolution clock if one is available.

 @implSpec
 This abstract class must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The principal methods are defined to allow the throwing of an exception.
 In normal use, no exceptions will be thrown, however one possible implementation would be to
 obtain the time from a central time server across the network. Obviously, in this case the
 lookup could fail, and so the method is permitted to throw an exception.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The returned instants from {@code Clock} work on a time-scale that ignores leap seconds,
 as described in {@link java.time.Instant}. If the implementation wraps a source that provides leap
 second information, then a mechanism should be used to &quot;smooth&quot; the leap second.
 The Java Time-Scale mandates the use of UTC-SLS, however clock implementations may choose
 how accurate they are with the time-scale so long as they document how they work.
 Implementations are therefore not required to actually perform the UTC-SLS slew or to
 otherwise be aware of leap seconds.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Implementations should implement {@code Serializable} wherever possible and must
 document whether or not they do support serialization.

 @implNote
 The clock implementation provided here is based on {@link System#currentTimeMillis()}.
 That method provides little to no guarantee about the accuracy of the clock.
 Applications requiring a more accurate clock must implement this abstract class
 themselves using a different external clock, such as an NTP server.
