 A year-month in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as {@code 2007-12}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 {@code YearMonth} is an immutable date-time object that represents the combination
 of a year and month. Any field that can be derived from a year and month, such as
 quarter-of-year, can be obtained.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This class does not store or represent a day, time or time-zone.
 For example, the value &quot;October 2007&quot; can be stored in a {@code YearMonth}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
 system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
 For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
 However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
 to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.

 @implSpec
 This class is immutable and thread-safe.

</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input

 &lt;p&gt;
 The adjustment is equivalent to using {@link Temporal#with(TemporalField, long)}
 passing {@link ChronoField#PROLEPTIC_MONTH} as the field.
 If the specified temporal object does not use the ISO calendar system then
 a {@code DateTimeException} is thrown.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using
 {@link Temporal#with(TemporalAdjuster)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
   temporal = thisYearMonth.adjustInto(temporal);
   temporal = temporal.with(thisYearMonth);

<span id='java-time-YearMonth-method-until'>/**Calculates the amount of time until another year-month in terms of the specified unit.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This calculates the amount of time between two {@code YearMonth}
 objects in terms of a single {@code TemporalUnit}.
 The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified year-month.
 The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
 The {@code Temporal} passed to this method is converted to a
 {@code YearMonth} using {@link #from}(TemporalAccessor).
 For example, the amount in years between two year-months can be calculated
 using {@code startYearMonth.until(endYearMonth, YEARS)}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
 complete units between the two year-months.
 For example, the amount in decades between 2012-06 and 2032-05
 will only be one decade as it is one month short of two decades.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 The first is to invoke this method.
 The second is to use {@link TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent
   amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
   amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation is implemented in this method for {@link ChronoUnit}.
 The units {@code MONTHS}, {@code YEARS}, {@code DECADES},
 {@code CENTURIES}, {@code MILLENNIA} and {@code ERAS} are supported.
 Other {@code ChronoUnit} values will throw an exception.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
 is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
 passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal
 as the second argument.
