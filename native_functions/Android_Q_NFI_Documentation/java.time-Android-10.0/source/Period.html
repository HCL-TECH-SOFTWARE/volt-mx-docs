</span> implements java.time.chrono.ChronoPeriod

 implements java.io.Serializable

@extends java.lang.Object

 A date-based amount of time in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 such as '2 years, 3 months and 4 days'.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This class models a quantity or amount of time in terms of years, months and days.
 See {@link java.time.Duration} for the time-based equivalent to this class.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Durations and periods differ in their treatment of daylight savings time
 when added to {@link java.time.ZonedDateTime}. A {@code Duration} will add an exact
 number of seconds, thus a duration of one day is always exactly 24 hours.
 By contrast, a {@code Period} will add a conceptual day, trying to maintain
 the local time.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For example, consider adding a period of one day and a duration of one day to
 18:00 on the evening before a daylight savings gap. The {@code Period} will add
 the conceptual day and result in a {@code ZonedDateTime} at 18:00 the following day.
 By contrast, the {@code Duration} will add exactly 24 hours, resulting in a
 {@code ZonedDateTime} at 19:00 the following day (assuming a one hour DST gap).
 &lt;p&gt;
 The supported units of a period are {@link ChronoUnit#YEARS YEARS},
 {@link ChronoUnit#MONTHS MONTHS} and {@link ChronoUnit#DAYS DAYS}.
 All three fields are always present, but may be set to zero.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
 system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The period is modeled as a directed amount of time, meaning that individual parts of the
 period may be negative.

 based on the ISO-8601 period formats {@code PnYnMnD} and {@code PnW}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The string starts with an optional sign, denoted by the ASCII negative
 or positive symbol. If negative, the whole period is negated.
 The ASCII letter &quot;P&quot; is next in upper or lower case.
 There are then four sections, each consisting of a number and a suffix.
 At least one of the four sections must be present.
 The sections have suffixes in ASCII of &quot;Y&quot;, &quot;M&quot;, &quot;W&quot; and &quot;D&quot; for
 years, months, weeks and days, accepted in upper or lower case.
 The suffixes must occur in order.
 The number part of each section must consist of ASCII digits.
 The number may be prefixed by the ASCII negative or positive symbol.
 The number must parse to an {@code int}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The leading plus/minus sign, and negative values for other units are
 not part of the ISO-8601 standard. In addition, ISO-8601 does not
 permit mixing between the {@code PnYnMnD} and {@code PnW} formats.
 Any week-based input is multiplied by 7 and treated as a number of days.

 of &quot;1 Year and 3 Months&quot;.
