</span> implements java.time.temporal.Temporal

 implements java.time.chrono.ChronoZonedDateTime

 implements java.io.Serializable

@extends java.lang.Object

 A date-time with a time-zone in the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 such as {@code 2007-12-03T10:15:30+01:00 Europe/Paris}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 {@code ZonedDateTime} is an immutable representation of a date-time with a time-zone.
 This class stores all date and time fields, to a precision of nanoseconds,
 and a time-zone, with a zone offset used to handle ambiguous local date-times.
 For example, the value
 &quot;2nd October 2007 at 13:45.30.123456789 +02:00 in the Europe/Paris time-zone&quot;
 can be stored in a {@code ZonedDateTime}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This class handles conversion from the local time-line of {@code LocalDateTime}
 to the instant time-line of {@code Instant}.
 The difference between the two time-lines is the offset from UTC/Greenwich,
 represented by a {@code ZoneOffset}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Converting between the two time-lines involves calculating the offset using the
 {@link ZoneRules rules} accessed from the {@code ZoneId}.
 Obtaining the offset for an instant is simple, as there is exactly one valid
 offset for each instant. By contrast, obtaining the offset for a local date-time
 is not straightforward. There are three cases:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal
  case applies, where there is a single valid offset for the local date-time.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Gap, with zero valid offsets. This is when clocks jump forward typically
  due to the spring daylight savings change from &quot;winter&quot; to &quot;summer&quot;.
  In a gap there are local date-time values with no valid offset.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back typically
  due to the autumn daylight savings change from &quot;summer&quot; to &quot;winter&quot;.
  In an overlap there are local date-time values with two valid offsets.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Any method that converts directly or implicitly from a local date-time to an
 instant by obtaining the offset has the potential to be complicated.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For Gaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
 middle of a Gap, then the resulting zoned date-time will have a local date-time
 shifted forwards by the length of the Gap, resulting in a date-time in the later
 offset, typically &quot;summer&quot; time.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For Overlaps, the general strategy is that if the local date-time falls in the
 middle of an Overlap, then the previous offset will be retained. If there is no
 previous offset, or the previous offset is invalid, then the earlier offset is
 used, typically &quot;summer&quot; time.. Two additional methods,
 {@link #withEarlierOffsetAtOverlap}() and {@link #withLaterOffsetAtOverlap}(),
 help manage the case of an overlap.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In terms of design, this class should be viewed primarily as the combination
 of a {@code LocalDateTime} and a {@code ZoneId}. The {@code ZoneOffset} is
 a vital, but secondary, piece of information, used to ensure that the class
 represents an instant, especially during a daylight savings overlap.

 @implSpec
 A {@code ZonedDateTime} holds state equivalent to three separate objects,
 a {@code LocalDateTime}, a {@code ZoneId} and the resolved {@code ZoneOffset}.
 The offset and local date-time are used to define an instant when necessary.
 The zone ID is used to obtain the rules for how and when the offset changes.
 The offset cannot be freely set, as the zone controls which offsets are valid.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This class is immutable and thread-safe.

 This returns a {@code ZonedDateTime}, based on this one, with the date-time adjusted.
 The adjustment takes place using the specified adjuster strategy object.
 Read the documentation of the adjuster to understand what adjustment will be made.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.
 A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.
 A selection of common adjustments is provided in
 {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters TemporalAdjusters}.
 These include finding the &quot;last day of the month&quot; and &quot;next Wednesday&quot;.
 Key date-time classes also implement the {@code TemporalAdjuster} interface,
 such as {@link java.time.Month} and {@link java.time.MonthDay MonthDay}.
 The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying
 lengths of month and leap years.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For example this code returns a date on the last day of July:
 &lt;pre&gt;
  import static java.time.Month.*;
  import static java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjusters.*;

  result = zonedDateTime.with(JULY).with(lastDayOfMonth());
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The classes {@link java.time.LocalDate} and {@link java.time.LocalTime} implement {@code TemporalAdjuster},
 thus this method can be used to change the date, time or offset:
 &lt;pre&gt;
  result = zonedDateTime.with(date);
  result = zonedDateTime.with(time);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 {@link java.time.ZoneOffset} also implements {@code TemporalAdjuster} however using it
 as an argument typically has no effect. The offset of a {@code ZonedDateTime} is
 controlled primarily by the time-zone. As such, changing the offset does not generally
 make sense, because there is only one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
 If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
 to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The result of this method is obtained by invoking the
 {@link TemporalAdjuster#adjustInto(Temporal)} method on the
 specified adjuster passing {@code this} as the argument.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.

@return {Object {java.time.ZonedDateTime}} a {@code ZonedDateTime} based on {@code this} with the adjustment made, not null

</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This returns a {@code ZonedDateTime}, based on this one, with the value
 for the specified field changed.
 This can be used to change any supported field, such as the year, month or day-of-month.
 If it is not possible to set the value, because the field is not supported or for
 some other reason, an exception is thrown.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In some cases, changing the specified field can cause the resulting date-time to become invalid,
 such as changing the month from 31st January to February would make the day-of-month invalid.
 In cases like this, the field is responsible for resolving the date. Typically it will choose
 the previous valid date, which would be the last valid day of February in this example.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If the field is a {@link ChronoField} then the adjustment is implemented here.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@code INSTANT_SECONDS} field will return a date-time with the specified instant.
 The zone and nano-of-second are unchanged.
 The result will have an offset derived from the new instant and original zone.
 If the new instant value is outside the valid range then a {@code DateTimeException} will be thrown.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@code OFFSET_SECONDS} field will typically be ignored.
 The offset of a {@code ZonedDateTime} is controlled primarily by the time-zone.
 As such, changing the offset does not generally make sense, because there is only
 one valid offset for the local date-time and zone.
 If the zoned date-time is in a daylight savings overlap, then the offset is used
 to switch between the two valid offsets. In all other cases, the offset is ignored.
 If the new offset value is outside the valid range then a {@code DateTimeException} will be thrown.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The other {@link #isSupported(TemporalField) supported fields} will behave as per
 the matching method on {@link java.time.LocalDateTime#with(TemporalField, long) java.time.LocalDateTime}.
 The zone is not part of the calculation and will be unchanged.
 When converting back to {@code ZonedDateTime}, if the local date-time is in an overlap,
 then the offset will be retained if possible, otherwise the earlier offset will be used.
 If in a gap, the local date-time will be adjusted forward by the length of the gap.
 &lt;p&gt;
 All other {@code ChronoField} instances will throw an {@code UnsupportedTemporalTypeException}.

 If the field is not a {@code ChronoField}, then the result of this method

 This calculates the amount of time between two {@code ZonedDateTime}
 objects in terms of a single {@code TemporalUnit}.
 The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified date-time.
 The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
 For example, the amount in days between two date-times can be calculated
 using {@code startDateTime.until(endDateTime, DAYS)}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@code Temporal} passed to this method is converted to a
 {@code ZonedDateTime} using {@link #from}(TemporalAccessor).
 If the time-zone differs between the two zoned date-times, the specified
 end date-time is normalized to have the same zone as this date-time.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
 complete units between the two date-times.
 For example, the amount in months between 2012-06-15T00:00Z and 2012-08-14T23:59Z
 will only be one month as it is one minute short of two months.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 The first is to invoke this method.
 The second is to use {@link TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent
   amount = start.until(end, MONTHS);
   amount = MONTHS.between(start, end);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation is implemented in this method for {@link ChronoUnit}.
 The units {@code NANOS}, {@code MICROS}, {@code MILLIS}, {@code SECONDS},
 {@code MINUTES}, {@code HOURS} and {@code HALF_DAYS}, {@code DAYS},
 {@code WEEKS}, {@code MONTHS}, {@code YEARS}, {@code DECADES},
 {@code CENTURIES}, {@code MILLENNIA} and {@code ERAS} are supported.
 Other {@code ChronoUnit} values will throw an exception.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation for date and time units differ.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Date units operate on the local time-line, using the local date-time.
 For example, the period from noon on day 1 to noon the following day
 in days will always be counted as exactly one day, irrespective of whether
 there was a daylight savings change or not.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Time units operate on the instant time-line.
 The calculation effectively converts both zoned date-times to instants
 and then calculates the period between the instants.
 For example, the period from noon on day 1 to noon the following day
 in hours may be 23, 24 or 25 hours (or some other amount) depending on
 whether there was a daylight savings change or not.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
 is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
 passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal
 as the second argument.
