 A year in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as {@code 2007}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 {@code Year} is an immutable date-time object that represents a year.
 Any field that can be derived from a year can be obtained.
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Note that years in the ISO chronology only align with years in the
 Gregorian-Julian system for modern years. Parts of Russia did not switch to the
 modern Gregorian/ISO rules until 1920.
 As such, historical years must be treated with caution.&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 This class does not store or represent a month, day, time or time-zone.
 For example, the value &quot;2007&quot; can be stored in a {@code Year}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Years represented by this class follow the ISO-8601 standard and use
 the proleptic numbering system. Year 1 is preceded by year 0, then by year -1.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today
 in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar
 system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.
 For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.
 However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them
 to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.

 @implSpec
 This class is immutable and thread-safe.

 This calculates the amount of time between two {@code Year}
 objects in terms of a single {@code TemporalUnit}.
 The start and end points are {@code this} and the specified year.
 The result will be negative if the end is before the start.
 The {@code Temporal} passed to this method is converted to a
 {@code Year} using {@link #from}(TemporalAccessor).
 For example, the amount in decades between two year can be calculated
 using {@code startYear.until(endYear, DECADES)}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation returns a whole number, representing the number of
 complete units between the two years.
 For example, the amount in decades between 2012 and 2031
 will only be one decade as it is one year short of two decades.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two equivalent ways of using this method.
 The first is to invoke this method.
 The second is to use {@link TemporalUnit#between(Temporal, Temporal)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent
   amount = start.until(end, YEARS);
   amount = YEARS.between(start, end);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 The choice should be made based on which makes the code more readable.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The calculation is implemented in this method for {@link ChronoUnit}.
 The units {@code YEARS}, {@code DECADES}, {@code CENTURIES},
 {@code MILLENNIA} and {@code ERAS} are supported.
 Other {@code ChronoUnit} values will throw an exception.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If the unit is not a {@code ChronoUnit}, then the result of this method
 is obtained by invoking {@code TemporalUnit.between(Temporal, Temporal)}
 passing {@code this} as the first argument and the converted input temporal
 as the second argument.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This instance is immutable and unaffected by this method call.
