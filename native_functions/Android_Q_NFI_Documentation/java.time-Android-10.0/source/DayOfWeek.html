@extends java.lang.Enum

 A day-of-week, such as 'Tuesday'.
 &lt;p&gt;
 {@code DayOfWeek} is an enum representing the 7 days of the week -
 Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In addition to the textual enum name, each day-of-week has an {@code int} value.
 The {@code int} value follows the ISO-8601 standard, from 1 (Monday) to 7 (Sunday).
 It is recommended that applications use the enum rather than the {@code int} value
 to ensure code clarity.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This enum provides access to the localized textual form of the day-of-week.
 Some locales also assign different numeric values to the days, declaring
 Sunday to have the value 1, however this class provides no support for this.
 See {@link WeekFields} for localized week-numbering.
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Do not use {@code ordinal()} to obtain the numeric representation of {@code DayOfWeek}.
 Use {@code getValue()} instead.&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 This enum represents a common concept that is found in many calendar systems.
 As such, this enum may be used by any calendar system that has the day-of-week
 concept defined exactly equivalent to the ISO calendar system.

 @implSpec
 This is an immutable and thread-safe enum.

</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This returns a temporal object of the same observable type as the input

 The adjustment is equivalent to using {@link Temporal#with(TemporalField, long)}
 passing {@link ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK} as the field.
 Note that this adjusts forwards or backwards within a Monday to Sunday week.
 See {@link java.time.temporal.WeekFields#dayOfWeek()} for localized week start days.
 See {@code TemporalAdjuster} for other adjusters with more control,
 such as {@code next(MONDAY)}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In most cases, it is clearer to reverse the calling pattern by using
 {@link Temporal#with(TemporalAdjuster)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
   temporal = thisDayOfWeek.adjustInto(temporal);
   temporal = temporal.with(thisDayOfWeek);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 For example, given a date that is a Wednesday, the following are output:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   dateOnWed.with(MONDAY);     // two days earlier
   dateOnWed.with(TUESDAY);    // one day earlier
   dateOnWed.with(WEDNESDAY);  // same date
   dateOnWed.with(THURSDAY);   // one day later
   dateOnWed.with(FRIDAY);     // two days later
   dateOnWed.with(SATURDAY);   // three days later
   dateOnWed.with(SUNDAY);     // four days later
 &lt;/pre&gt;
