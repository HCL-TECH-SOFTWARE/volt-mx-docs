 Provides access to device usage history and statistics. Usage data is aggregated into
 time intervals: days, weeks, months, and years.
 &lt;p /&gt;
 When requesting usage data since a particular time, the request might look something like this:
 &lt;pre&gt;
 PAST                   REQUEST_TIME                    TODAY                   FUTURE
 ————————————————————————————||———————————————————————————¦-----------------------|
                        YEAR ||                           ¦                       |
 ————————————————————————————||———————————————————————————¦-----------------------|
  MONTH            |         ||                MONTH      ¦                       |
 ——————————————————|—————————||———————————————————————————¦-----------------------|

 ————————————————————————————||———————————————————————————¦-----------------------|
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 A request for data in the middle of a time interval will include that interval.
 &lt;p/&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;NOTE:&lt;/b&gt; Most methods on this API require the permission
 android.permission.PACKAGE_USAGE_STATS. However, declaring the permission implies intention to
 use the API and the user of the device still needs to grant permission through the Settings
 application.
 See {@link android.provider.Settings#ACTION_USAGE_ACCESS_SETTINGS}.
 Methods which only return the information for the calling package do not require this permission.
 E.g. {@link #getAppStandbyBucket}() and {@link #queryEventsForSelf(long, long)}.
