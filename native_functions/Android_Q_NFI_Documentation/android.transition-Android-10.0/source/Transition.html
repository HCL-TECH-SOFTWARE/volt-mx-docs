</span> implements java.lang.Cloneable

@extends java.lang.Object

 A Transition holds information about animations that will be run on its
 targets during a scene change. Subclasses of this abstract class may
 choreograph several child transitions ({@link android.transition.TransitionSet} or they may
 perform custom animations themselves. Any Transition has two main jobs:
 (1) capture property values, and (2) play animations based on changes to
 captured property values. A custom transition knows what property values
 on View objects are of interest to it, and also knows how to animate
 changes to those values. For example, the {@link android.transition.Fade} transition tracks
 changes to visibility-related properties and is able to construct and run
 animations that fade items in or out based on changes to those properties.

 &lt;p&gt;Note: Transitions may not work correctly with either {@link SurfaceView}
 or {@link TextureView}, due to the way that these views are displayed
 on the screen. For SurfaceView, the problem is that the view is updated from
 a non-UI thread, so changes to the view due to transitions (such as moving
 and resizing the view) may be out of sync with the display inside those bounds.
 TextureView is more compatible with transitions in general, but some
 specific transitions (such as {@link android.transition.Fade}) may not be compatible
 with TextureView because they rely on {@link ViewOverlay} functionality,
 which does not currently work with TextureView.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Transitions can be declared in XML resource files inside the &lt;code&gt;res/transition&lt;/code&gt;
 directory. Transition resources consist of a tag name for one of the Transition
 subclasses along with attributes to define some of the attributes of that transition.
 For example, here is a minimal resource file that declares a {@link android.transition.ChangeBounds} transition:

 {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/transition/changebounds.xml ChangeBounds}

 &lt;p&gt;This TransitionSet contains {@link android.transition.Explode} for visibility,
 {@link android.transition.ChangeBounds}, {@link android.transition.ChangeTransform},
 and {@link android.transition.ChangeClipBounds} and
 {@link android.transition.ChangeImageTransform}:&lt;/p&gt;

 {@sample development/samples/ApiDemos/res/transition/explode_move_together.xml MultipleTransform}

 &lt;p&gt;Custom transition classes may be instantiated with a &lt;code&gt;transition&lt;/code&gt; tag:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;pre&gt;&amp;lt;transition class=&quot;my.app.transition.CustomTransition&quot;/&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Custom transition classes loaded from XML should have a public constructor taking
 a {@link android.content.Context} and {@link android.util.AttributeSet}.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Note that attributes for the transition are not required, just as they are
 optional when declared in code; Transitions created from XML resources will use
 the same defaults as their code-created equivalents. Here is a slightly more
 elaborate example which declares a {@link android.transition.TransitionSet} transition with
 {@link android.transition.ChangeBounds} and {@link android.transition.Fade} child transitions:&lt;/p&gt;

 {@sample
 development/samples/ApiDemos/res/transition/changebounds_fadeout_sequential.xml TransitionSet}

 &lt;p&gt;In this example, the transitionOrdering attribute is used on the TransitionSet
 object to change from the default {@link android.transition.TransitionSet#ORDERING_TOGETHER} behavior
 to be {@link android.transition.TransitionSet#ORDERING_SEQUENTIAL} instead. Also, the {@link android.transition.Fade}
 transition uses a fadingMode of {@link android.transition.Fade#OUT} instead of the default
 out-in behavior. Finally, note the use of the &lt;code&gt;targets&lt;/code&gt; sub-tag, which
 takes a set of {@link android.R.styleable#TransitionTarget target} tags, each
 of which lists a specific &lt;code&gt;targetId&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;targetClass&lt;/code&gt;,
 &lt;code&gt;targetName&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;excludeId&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;excludeClass&lt;/code&gt;, or
 &lt;code&gt;excludeName&lt;/code&gt;, which this transition acts upon.
 Use of targets is optional, but can be used to either limit the time spent checking
 attributes on unchanging views, or limiting the types of animations run on specific views.
 In this case, we know that only the &lt;code&gt;grayscaleContainer&lt;/code&gt; will be
 disappearing, so we choose to limit the {@link android.transition.Fade} transition to only that view.&lt;/p&gt;

 {@link android.R.styleable#Transition}, {@link android.R.styleable#TransitionSet},
 {@link android.R.styleable#TransitionTarget}, {@link android.R.styleable#Fade},

 currently running on that same scene root are checked to see whether the
 properties on which they based their animations agree with the end values of
 the same properties in the new transition. If the end values are not equal,
 then the old animation is canceled since the new transition will start a new
 animation to these new values. If the values are equal, the old animation is
 allowed to continue and no new animation is started for that transition.

 &lt;p&gt;A transition does not need to override this method. However, not doing so

 not intended to be called from external classes.

 &lt;p&gt;This method is called by the transition's parent (all the way up to the
 topmost Transition in the hierarchy) with the sceneRoot and start/end
 values that the transition may need to set up initial target values
 and construct an appropriate animation. For example, if an overall
 Transition is a {@link android.transition.TransitionSet} consisting of several
 child transitions in sequence, then some of the child transitions may
 want to set initial values on target views prior to the overall
 Transition commencing, to put them in an appropriate state for the
 delay between that start and the child Transition start time. For
 example, a transition that fades an item in may wish to set the starting
 alpha value to 0, to avoid it blinking in prior to the transition
 actually starting the animation. This is necessary because the scene
 change that triggers the Transition will automatically set the end-scene
 on all target views, so a Transition that wants to animate from a
 different value should set that value prior to returning from this method.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Additionally, a Transition can perform logic to determine whether
 the transition needs to run on the given target and start/end values.
 For example, a transition that resizes objects on the screen may wish
 to avoid running for views which are not present in either the start
 or end scenes.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If there is an animator created and returned from this method, the
 transition mechanism will apply any applicable duration, startDelay,
