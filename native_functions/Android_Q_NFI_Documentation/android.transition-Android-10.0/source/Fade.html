 This transition tracks changes to the visibility of target views in the
 start and end scenes and fades views in or out when they become visible
 or non-visible. Visibility is determined by both the
 {@link View#setVisibility(int)} state of the view as well as whether it
 is parented in the current view hierarchy.

 &lt;p&gt;The ability of this transition to fade out a particular view, and the
 way that that fading operation takes place, is based on
 the situation of the view in the view hierarchy. For example, if a view was
 simply removed from its parent, then the view will be added into a {@link android.view.ViewGroupOverlay} while fading. If a visible view is
 changed to be {@link View#GONE} or {@link View#INVISIBLE}, then the
 visibility will be changed to {@link View#VISIBLE} for the duration of
 the animation. However, if a view is in a hierarchy which is also altering
 its visibility, the situation can be more complicated. In general, if a
 view that is no longer in the hierarchy in the end scene still has a
 parent (so its parent hierarchy was removed, but it was not removed from
 its parent), then it will be left alone to avoid side-effects from
 improperly removing it from its parent. The only exception to this is if
 the previous {@link android.transition.Scene} was
 {@link android.transition.Scene#getandroid.transition.SceneForLayout(android.view.ViewGroup, int, android.content.Context)
 created from a layout resource file}, then it is considered safe to un-parent
 the starting scene view in order to fade it out.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A Fade transition can be described in a resource file by using the
 tag &lt;code&gt;fade&lt;/code&gt;, along with the standard
 attributes of {@link android.R.styleable#Fade} and
 {@link android.R.styleable#Transition}.&lt;/p&gt;
