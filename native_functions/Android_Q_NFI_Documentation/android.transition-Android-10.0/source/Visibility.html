 This transition tracks changes to the visibility of target views in the
 start and end scenes. Visibility is determined not just by the
 {@link View#setVisibility(int)} state of views, but also whether
 views exist in the current view hierarchy. The class is intended to be a
 utility for subclasses such as {@link android.transition.Fade}, which use this visibility
 information to determine the specific animations to run when visibility
 changes occur. Subclasses should implement one or both of the methods
 {@link #onAppear(ViewGroup, android.transition.TransitionValues, int, android.transition.TransitionValues, int)},
 {@link #onDisappear(ViewGroup, android.transition.TransitionValues, int, android.transition.TransitionValues, int)} or
 {@link #onAppear(ViewGroup, View, android.transition.TransitionValues, android.transition.TransitionValues)},
 {@link #onDisappear(ViewGroup, View, android.transition.TransitionValues, android.transition.TransitionValues)}.

 The method should only be called by the Visibility class; it is

 &lt;p&gt;
 The default implementation of this method attempts to find a View to use to call
 {@link #onDisappear(ViewGroup, View, android.transition.TransitionValues, android.transition.TransitionValues)},
 based on the situation of the View in the View hierarchy. For example,
 if a View was simply removed from its parent, then the View will be added
 into a {@link android.view.ViewGroupOverlay} and passed as the &lt;code&gt;view&lt;/code&gt;
 parameter in {@link #onDisappear(ViewGroup, View, android.transition.TransitionValues, android.transition.TransitionValues)}.
 If a visible View is changed to be {@link View#GONE} or {@link View#INVISIBLE},
 then it can be used as the &lt;code&gt;view&lt;/code&gt; and the visibility will be changed
 to {@link View#VISIBLE} for the duration of the animation. However, if a View
 is in a hierarchy which is also altering its visibility, the situation can be
 more complicated. In general, if a view that is no longer in the hierarchy in
 the end scene still has a parent (so its parent hierarchy was removed, but it
 was not removed from its parent), then it will be left alone to avoid side-effects from
 improperly removing it from its parent. The only exception to this is if
 the previous {@link android.transition.Scene} was {@link android.transition.Scene#getandroid.transition.SceneForLayout(ViewGroup, int,
 android.content.Context) created from a layout resource file}, then it is considered
 safe to un-parent the starting scene view in order to make it disappear.&lt;/p&gt;
