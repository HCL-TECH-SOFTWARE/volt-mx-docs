</span>@extends java.util.prefs.Preferences

 This class provides a skeletal implementation of the {@link java.util.prefs.Preferences}
 class, greatly easing the task of implementing it.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This class is for &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt; implementers only.
 Normal users of the &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt; facility should have no need to
 consult this documentation.  The {@link java.util.prefs.Preferences} documentation
 should suffice.&lt;/strong&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Implementors must override the nine abstract service-provider interface
 (SPI) methods: {@link #getSpi}(String), {@link #putSpi(String,String)},
 {@link #removeSpi}(String), {@link #childSpi}(String), {@link #removeNodeSpi}(), {@link #keysSpi}(), {@link #childrenNamesSpi}(), {@link #syncSpi}() and {@link #flushSpi}().  All of the concrete methods specify
 precisely how they are implemented atop these SPI methods.  The implementor
 may, at his discretion, override one or more of the concrete methods if the
 default implementation is unsatisfactory for any reason, such as
 performance.

 &lt;p&gt;The SPI methods fall into three groups concerning exception
 behavior. The &lt;tt&gt;getSpi&lt;/tt&gt; method should never throw exceptions, but it
 doesn't really matter, as any exception thrown by this method will be
 intercepted by {@link #get(String,String)}, which will return the specified
 default value to the caller.  The &lt;tt&gt;removeNodeSpi, keysSpi,
 childrenNamesSpi, syncSpi&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;flushSpi&lt;/tt&gt; methods are specified
 to throw {@link java.util.prefs.BackingStoreException}, and the implementation is required
 to throw this checked exception if it is unable to perform the operation.
 The exception propagates outward, causing the corresponding API method
 to fail.

 &lt;p&gt;The remaining SPI methods {@link #putSpi(String,String)}, {@link #removeSpi}(String) and {@link #childSpi}(String) have more complicated
 exception behavior.  They are not specified to throw
 &lt;tt&gt;BackingStoreException&lt;/tt&gt;, as they can generally obey their contracts
 even if the backing store is unavailable.  This is true because they return
 no information and their effects are not required to become permanent until
 a subsequent call to {@link java.util.prefs.Preferences#flush()} or
 {@link java.util.prefs.Preferences#sync()}. Generally speaking, these SPI methods should not
 throw exceptions.  In some implementations, there may be circumstances
 under which these calls cannot even enqueue the requested operation for
 later processing.  Even under these circumstances it is generally better to
 simply ignore the invocation and return, rather than throwing an
 exception.  Under these circumstances, however, all subsequent invocations
 of &lt;tt&gt;flush()&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;sync&lt;/tt&gt; should return &lt;tt&gt;false&lt;/tt&gt;, as
 returning &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; would imply that all previous operations had
 successfully been made permanent.

 &lt;p&gt;There is one circumstance under which &lt;tt&gt;putSpi, removeSpi and
 childSpi&lt;/tt&gt; &lt;i&gt;should&lt;/i&gt; throw an exception: if the caller lacks
 sufficient privileges on the underlying operating system to perform the
 requested operation.  This will, for instance, occur on most systems
 if a non-privileged user attempts to modify system preferences.
 (The required privileges will vary from implementation to
 implementation.  On some implementations, they are the right to modify the
 contents of some directory in the file system; on others they are the right
 to modify contents of some key in a registry.)  Under any of these
 circumstances, it would generally be undesirable to let the program
 continue executing as if these operations would become permanent at a later
 time.  While implementations are not required to throw an exception under
 these circumstances, they are encouraged to do so.  A {@link SecurityException} would be appropriate.

 &lt;p&gt;Most of the SPI methods require the implementation to read or write
 information at a preferences node.  The implementor should beware of the
 fact that another VM may have concurrently deleted this node from the
 backing store.  It is the implementation's responsibility to recreate the
 node if it has been deleted.

 &lt;p&gt;Implementation note: In Sun's default &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt;
 implementations, the user's identity is inherited from the underlying
 operating system and does not change for the lifetime of the virtual
 machine.  It is recognized that server-side &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt;
 implementations may have the user identity change from request to request,
 implicitly passed to &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt; methods via the use of a
 static {@link ThreadLocal} instance.  Authors of such implementations are
 &lt;i&gt;strongly&lt;/i&gt; encouraged to determine the user at the time preferences
 are accessed (for example by the {@link #get(String,String)} or {@link #put(String,String)} method) rather than permanently associating a user
 with each &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt; instance.  The latter behavior conflicts
 with normal &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt; usage and would lead to great confusion.

 &lt;p&gt;This implementation obtains this preference node's lock and checks
 that the node has not been removed.  If &lt;tt&gt;path&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;,
 this node is returned; if &lt;tt&gt;path&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/tt&gt;, this node's
 root is returned.  If the first character in &lt;tt&gt;path&lt;/tt&gt; is
 not &lt;tt&gt;'/'&lt;/tt&gt;, the implementation breaks &lt;tt&gt;path&lt;/tt&gt; into
 tokens and recursively traverses the path from this node to the
 named node, &quot;consuming&quot; a name and a slash from &lt;tt&gt;path&lt;/tt&gt; at
 each step of the traversal.  At each step, the current node is locked
 and the node's child-cache is checked for the named node.  If it is
 not found, the name is checked to make sure its length does not
 exceed &lt;tt&gt;MAX_NAME_LENGTH&lt;/tt&gt;.  Then the {@link #childSpi}(String)
 method is invoked, and the result stored in this node's child-cache.
 If the newly created &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt; object's {@link #newNode}
 field is &lt;tt&gt;true&lt;/tt&gt; and there are any node change listeners,
 a notification event is enqueued for processing by the event dispatch
 thread.

 &lt;p&gt;When there are no more tokens, the last value found in the
 child-cache or returned by &lt;tt&gt;childSpi&lt;/tt&gt; is returned by this
 method.  If during the traversal, two &lt;tt&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; tokens occur
 consecutively, or the final token is &lt;tt&gt;&quot;/&quot;&lt;/tt&gt; (rather than a name),
 an appropriate &lt;tt&gt;IllegalArgumentException&lt;/tt&gt; is thrown.

 &lt;p&gt; If the first character of &lt;tt&gt;path&lt;/tt&gt; is &lt;tt&gt;'/'&lt;/tt&gt;
 (indicating an absolute path name) this preference node's
 lock is dropped prior to breaking &lt;tt&gt;path&lt;/tt&gt; into tokens, and
 this method recursively traverses the path starting from the root
 (rather than starting from this node).  The traversal is otherwise
 identical to the one described for relative path names.  Dropping
 the lock on this node prior to commencing the traversal at the root
 node is essential to avoid the possibility of deadlock, as per the
 {@link #lock locking invariant}.

 &lt;p&gt;This implementation checks to see that this node is the root; if so,
 it throws an appropriate exception.  Then, it locks this node's parent,

 this node.  The recursive method locks the node on which it was called,
 checks that it has not already been removed, and then ensures that all
 of its children are cached: The {@link #childrenNamesSpi}() method is
 invoked and each returned child name is checked for containment in the
 child-cache.  If a child is not already cached, the {@link #childSpi}(String) method is invoked to create a &lt;tt&gt;Preferences&lt;/tt&gt;
 instance for it, and this instance is put into the child-cache.  Then
 the helper method calls itself recursively on each node contained in its
 child-cache.  Next, it invokes {@link #removeNodeSpi}(), marks itself
 as removed, and removes itself from its parent's child-cache.  Finally,
 if there are any node change listeners, it enqueues a notification
