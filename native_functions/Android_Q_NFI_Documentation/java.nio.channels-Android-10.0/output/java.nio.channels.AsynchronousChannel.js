Asynchronous I/O\n operations will usually take one of two forms:</p>\n\n<p> <ol>\n <li><pre>Future&lt;V&gt; <em>operation</em>(<em>...</em>)</pre></li>\n <li><pre>void <em>operation</em>(<em>...</em> A attachment, <a href=\"#!/api/java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler\" rel=\"java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler\" class=\"docClass\">java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler</a>&lt;V,? super A&gt; handler)</pre></li>\n </ol></p>\n\n<p> where <i>operation</i> is the name of the I/O operation (read or write for\n example), <i>V</i> is the result type of the I/O operation, and <i>A</i> is\n the type of an object attached to the I/O operation to provide context when\n consuming the result. The attachment is important for cases where a\n <em>state-less</em> {@code CompletionHandler} is used to consume the result\n of many I/O operations.</p>\n\n<p> <p> In the first form, the methods defined by the Future\n interface may be used to check if the operation has completed, wait for its\n completion, and to retrieve the result. In the second form, a <a href=\"#!/api/java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler\" rel=\"java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler\" class=\"docClass\">java.nio.channels.CompletionHandler</a> is invoked to consume the result of the I/O operation when\n it completes or fails.</p>\n\n<p> <p> A channel that implements this interface is <em>asynchronously\n closeable</em>: If an I/O operation is outstanding on the channel and the\n channel's <a href=\"#!/api/java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannel-method-close\" rel=\"java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannel-method-close\" class=\"docClass\">close</a> method is invoked, then the I/O operation\n fails with the exception <a href=\"#!/api/java.nio.channels.AsynchronousCloseException\" rel=\"java.nio.channels.AsynchronousCloseException\" class=\"docClass\">java.nio.channels.AsynchronousCloseException</a>.</p>\n\n<p> <p> Asynchronous channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads.\n Some channel implementations may support concurrent reading and writing, but\n may not allow more than one read and one write operation to be outstanding at\n any given time.</p>\n\n<p> <h2>Cancellation</h2></p>\n\n<p> <p> The {@code Future} interface defines the cancel\n method to cancel execution. This causes all threads waiting on the result of\n the I/O operation to throw java.util.concurrent.CancellationException.\n Whether the underlying I/O operation can be cancelled is highly implementation\n specific and therefore not specified. Where cancellation leaves the channel,\n or the entity to which it is connected, in an inconsistent state, then the\n channel is put into an implementation specific <em>error state</em> that\n prevents further attempts to initiate I/O operations that are <i>similar</i>\n to the operation that was cancelled. For example, if a read operation is\n cancelled but the implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been\n read from the channel then it puts the channel into an error state; further\n attempts to initiate a {@code read} operation cause an unspecified runtime\n exception to be thrown. Similarly, if a write operation is cancelled but the\n implementation cannot guarantee that bytes have not been written to the\n channel then subsequent attempts to initiate a {@code write} will fail with\n an unspecified runtime exception.</p>\n\n<p> <p> Where the cancel method is invoked with the {@code\n mayInterruptIfRunning} parameter set to {@code true} then the I/O operation\n may be interrupted by closing the channel. In that case all threads waiting\n on the result of the I/O operation throw {@code CancellationException} and\n any other I/O operations outstanding on the channel complete with the\n exception <a href=\"#!/api/java.nio.channels.AsynchronousCloseException\" rel=\"java.nio.channels.AsynchronousCloseException\" class=\"docClass\">java.nio.channels.AsynchronousCloseException</a>.</p>\n\n<p> <p> Where the {@code cancel} method is invoked to cancel read or write\n operations then it is recommended that all buffers used in the I/O operations\n be discarded or care taken to ensure that the buffers are not accessed while\n the channel remains open.</p>\n        <p>Available since: <b>1.7</b></p>\n</div><div class='members'><div class='members-section'><div class='definedBy'>Defined By</div><h3 class='members-title icon-method'>Methods</h3><div class='subsection'><div id='method-close' class='member first-child not-inherited'><a href='#' class='side expandable'><span>&nbsp;</span></a><div class='title'><div class='meta'><span class='defined-in' rel='java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannel'>java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannel</span><br/><a href='source/AsynchronousChannel.html#java-nio-channels-AsynchronousChannel-method-close' target='_blank' class='view-source'>view source</a></div><a href='#!/api/java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannel-method-close' class='name expandable'>close</a>( <span class='pre'></span> )<span class=\"signature\"></span></div><div class='description'><div class='short'>Closes this channel. ...</div><div class='long'><p>Closes this channel.</p>\n\n<p> <p> Any outstanding asynchronous operations upon this channel will\n complete with the exception <a href=\"#!/api/java.nio.channels.AsynchronousCloseException\" rel=\"java.nio.channels.AsynchronousCloseException\" class=\"docClass\">java.nio.channels.AsynchronousCloseException</a>.
