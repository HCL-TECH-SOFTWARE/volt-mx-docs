</span> implements java.nio.channels.NetworkChannel

 A network channel that supports Internet Protocol (IP) multicasting.

 &lt;p&gt; IP multicasting is the transmission of IP datagrams to members of
 a &lt;em&gt;group&lt;/em&gt; that is zero or more hosts identified by a single destination
 address.

 &lt;p&gt; In the case of a channel to an {@link StandardProtocolFamily#INET IPv4} socket,
 the underlying operating system supports &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2236.txt&quot;&gt;
 &lt;i&gt;RFC&amp;nbsp;2236: Internet Group Management Protocol, Version 2 (IGMPv2)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
 It may optionally support source filtering as specified by &lt;a
 href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3376.txt&quot;&gt; &lt;i&gt;RFC&amp;nbsp;3376: Internet Group
 Management Protocol, Version 3 (IGMPv3)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.
 For channels to an {@link StandardProtocolFamily#INET6 IPv6} socket, the equivalent
 standards are &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2710.txt&quot;&gt; &lt;i&gt;RFC&amp;nbsp;2710:
 Multicast Listener Discovery (MLD) for IPv6&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a
 href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3810.txt&quot;&gt; &lt;i&gt;RFC&amp;nbsp;3810: Multicast Listener
 Discovery Version 2 (MLDv2) for IPv6&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

 &lt;p&gt; The {@link #join(InetAddress,NetworkInterface)} method is used to
 join a group and receive all multicast datagrams sent to the group. A channel
 may join several multicast groups and may join the same group on several
 {@link NetworkInterface interfaces}. Membership is dropped by invoking the {@link java.nio.channels.MembershipKey#drop drop} method on the returned {@link java.nio.channels.MembershipKey}. If the
 underlying platform supports source filtering then the {@link java.nio.channels.MembershipKey#block
 block} and {@link java.nio.channels.MembershipKey#unblock unblock} methods can be used to block or
 unblock multicast datagrams from particular source addresses.

 &lt;p&gt; The {@link #join(InetAddress,NetworkInterface,InetAddress)} method
 is used to begin receiving datagrams sent to a group whose source address matches
 a given source address. This method throws {@link UnsupportedOperationException}
 if the underlying platform does not support source filtering.  Membership is
 &lt;em&gt;cumulative&lt;/em&gt; and this method may be invoked again with the same group
 and interface to allow receiving datagrams from other source addresses. The
 method returns a {@link java.nio.channels.MembershipKey} that represents membership to receive
 datagrams from the given source address. Invoking the key's {@link java.nio.channels.MembershipKey#drop drop} method drops membership so that datagrams from the
 source address can no longer be received.

 &lt;h2&gt;Platform dependencies&lt;/h2&gt;

 The multicast implementation is intended to map directly to the native
 multicasting facility. Consequently, the following items should be considered
 when developing an application that receives IP multicast datagrams:

 &lt;ol&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The creation of the channel should specify the {@link ProtocolFamily}
 that corresponds to the address type of the multicast groups that the channel
 will join. There is no guarantee that a channel to a socket in one protocol
 family can join and receive multicast datagrams when the address of the
 multicast group corresponds to another protocol family. For example, it is
 implementation specific if a channel to an {@link StandardProtocolFamily#INET6 IPv6}
 socket can join an {@link StandardProtocolFamily#INET IPv4} multicast group and receive
 multicast datagrams sent to the group. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The channel's socket should be bound to the {@link InetAddress#isAnyLocalAddress wildcard} address. If the socket is bound to
 a specific address, rather than the wildcard address then it is implementation
 specific if multicast datagrams are received by the socket. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} option should be
 enabled prior to {@link java.nio.channels.NetworkChannel#bind binding} the socket. This is
 required to allow multiple members of the group to bind to the same
 address. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;/ol&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Usage Example:&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;pre&gt;
     // join multicast group on this interface, and also use this
     // interface for outgoing multicast datagrams
     NetworkInterface ni = NetworkInterface.getByName(&quot;hme0&quot;);

     DatagramChannel dc = DatagramChannel.open(StandardProtocolFamily.INET)
         .setOption(StandardSocketOptions.SO_REUSEADDR, true)
         .bind(new InetSocketAddress(5000))
         .setOption(StandardSocketOptions.IP_MULTICAST_IF, ni);

     InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName(&quot;225.4.5.6&quot;);

     MembershipKey key = dc.join(group, ni);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
