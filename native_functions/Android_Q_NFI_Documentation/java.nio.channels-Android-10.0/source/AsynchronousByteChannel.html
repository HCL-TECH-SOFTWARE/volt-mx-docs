</span> implements java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannel

 An asynchronous channel that can read and write bytes.

 &lt;p&gt; Some channels may not allow more than one read or write to be outstanding
 at any given time. If a thread invokes a read method before a previous read
 operation has completed then a {@link java.nio.channels.ReadPendingException} will be thrown.
 Similarly, if a write method is invoked before a previous write has completed
 then {@link java.nio.channels.WritePendingException} is thrown. Whether or not other kinds of
 I/O operations may proceed concurrently with a read operation depends upon
 the type of the channel.

 &lt;p&gt; Note that {@link java.nio.ByteBuffer ByteBuffers} are not safe for use by
 multiple concurrent threads. When a read or write operation is initiated then
 care must be taken to ensure that the buffer is not accessed until the
 operation completes.

</span>
 &lt;p&gt; This method initiates an asynchronous read operation to read a
 sequence of bytes from this channel into the given buffer. The {@code
 handler} parameter is a completion handler that is invoked when the read
 operation completes (or fails). The result passed to the completion
 handler is the number of bytes read or {@code -1} if no bytes could be
 read because the channel has reached end-of-stream.

 &lt;p&gt; The read operation may read up to &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; bytes from the channel,
 where &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is the number of bytes remaining in the buffer, that is,
 {@code dst.remaining()} at the time that the read is attempted. Where
 &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is 0, the read operation completes immediately with a result of
 {@code 0} without initiating an I/O operation.

 &lt;p&gt; Suppose that a byte sequence of length &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is read, where
 &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;.
 This byte sequence will be transferred into the buffer so that the first
 byte in the sequence is at index &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; and the last byte is at index
 &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;,
 where &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; is the buffer's position at the moment the read is
 performed. Upon completion the buffer's position will be equal to
 &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;; its limit will not have changed.

 &lt;p&gt; Buffers are not safe for use by multiple concurrent threads so care
 should be taken to not access the buffer until the operation has
 completed.

 &lt;p&gt; This method may be invoked at any time. Some channel types may not
 allow more than one read to be outstanding at any given time. If a thread
