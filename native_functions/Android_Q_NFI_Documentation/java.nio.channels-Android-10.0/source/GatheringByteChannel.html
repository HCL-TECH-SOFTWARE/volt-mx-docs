</span> implements java.nio.channels.WritableByteChannel

 A channel that can write bytes from a sequence of buffers.

 &lt;p&gt; A &lt;i&gt;gathering&lt;/i&gt; write operation writes, in a single invocation, a
 sequence of bytes from one or more of a given sequence of buffers.
 Gathering writes are often useful when implementing network protocols or
 file formats that, for example, group data into segments consisting of one
 or more fixed-length headers followed by a variable-length body.  Similar
 &lt;i&gt;scattering&lt;/i&gt; read operations are defined in the {@link java.nio.channels.ScatteringByteChannel} interface.  &lt;/p&gt;

<span id='java-nio-channels-GatheringByteChannel-method-write'>/**Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from a subsequence of the
</span> given buffers.

 &lt;p&gt; An attempt is made to write up to &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; bytes to this channel,
 where &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is the total number of bytes remaining in the specified
 subsequence of the given buffer array, that is,

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
 srcs[offset].remaining()
     + srcs[offset+1].remaining()
     + ... + srcs[offset+length-1].remaining()&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 at the moment that this method is invoked.

 &lt;p&gt; Suppose that a byte sequence of length &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is written, where
 &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;.
 Up to the first &lt;tt&gt;srcs[offset].remaining()&lt;/tt&gt; bytes of this sequence
 are written from buffer &lt;tt&gt;srcs[offset]&lt;/tt&gt;, up to the next
 &lt;tt&gt;srcs[offset+1].remaining()&lt;/tt&gt; bytes are written from buffer
 &lt;tt&gt;srcs[offset+1]&lt;/tt&gt;, and so forth, until the entire byte sequence is
 written.  As many bytes as possible are written from each buffer, hence
 the final position of each updated buffer, except the last updated
 buffer, is guaranteed to be equal to that buffer's limit.

 &lt;p&gt; Unless otherwise specified, a write operation will return only after
 writing all of the &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; requested bytes.  Some types of channels,
 depending upon their state, may write only some of the bytes or possibly
 none at all.  A socket channel in non-blocking mode, for example, cannot
 write any more bytes than are free in the socket's output buffer.

 &lt;p&gt; This method may be invoked at any time.  If another thread has
 already initiated a write operation upon this channel, however, then an
 invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
 complete. &lt;/p&gt;
@param {Object {java.nio.ByteBuffer[]}} srcs
         The buffers from which bytes are to be retrieved
@param {Number} offset

         which bytes are to be retrieved; must be non-negative and no
         larger than &lt;tt&gt;srcs.length&lt;/tt&gt;
@param {Number} length
         The maximum number of buffers to be accessed; must be
         non-negative and no larger than
         &lt;tt&gt;srcs.length&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;offset&lt;/tt&gt;

          while the write operation is in progress, thereby
