 A token representing the membership of an Internet Protocol (IP) multicast
 group.

 &lt;p&gt; A membership key may represent a membership to receive all datagrams sent
 to the group, or it may be &lt;em&gt;source-specific&lt;/em&gt;, meaning that it
 represents a membership that receives only datagrams from a specific source
 address. Whether or not a membership key is source-specific may be determined
 by invoking its {@link #sourceAddress() sourceAddress} method.

 &lt;p&gt; A membership key is valid upon creation and remains valid until the
 membership is dropped by invoking the {@link #drop() drop} method, or
 the channel is closed. The validity of the membership key may be tested
 by invoking its {@link #isValid() isValid} method.

 &lt;p&gt; Where a membership key is not source-specific and the underlying operation
 system supports source filtering, then the {@link #block block} and {@link #unblock unblock} methods can be used to block or unblock multicast datagrams
 from particular source addresses.

 then the channel will no longer receive datagrams sent to the group from
 that source address.

 &lt;p&gt; After membership is dropped it may still be possible to receive
 datagrams sent to the group. This can arise when datagrams are waiting to
 be received in the socket's receive buffer. After membership is dropped
 then the channel may {@link java.nio.channels.MulticastChannel#join join} the group again
 in which case a new membership key is returned.

 &lt;p&gt; Upon return, this membership object will be {@link #isValid() invalid}.
 If the multicast group membership is already invalid then invoking this

 it remains invalid forever.
