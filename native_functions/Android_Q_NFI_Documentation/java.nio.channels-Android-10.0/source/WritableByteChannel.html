</span> implements java.nio.channels.Channel

 A channel that can write bytes.

 &lt;p&gt; Only one write operation upon a writable channel may be in progress at
 any given time.  If one thread initiates a write operation upon a channel
 then any other thread that attempts to initiate another write operation will
 block until the first operation is complete.  Whether or not other kinds of
 I/O operations may proceed concurrently with a write operation depends upon
 the type of the channel. &lt;/p&gt;

var WritableByteChannel = {

<span id='java-nio-channels-WritableByteChannel-method-write'>/**Writes a sequence of bytes to this channel from the given buffer.
</span>
 &lt;p&gt; An attempt is made to write up to &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; bytes to the channel,
 where &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; is the number of bytes remaining in the buffer, that is,
 &lt;tt&gt;src.remaining()&lt;/tt&gt;, at the moment this method is invoked.

 &lt;p&gt; Suppose that a byte sequence of length &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is written, where
 &lt;tt&gt;0&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt;.
 This byte sequence will be transferred from the buffer starting at index
 &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; is the buffer's position at the moment this
 method is invoked; the index of the last byte written will be
 &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;1&lt;/tt&gt;.
 Upon return the buffer's position will be equal to
 &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;; its limit will not have changed.

 &lt;p&gt; Unless otherwise specified, a write operation will return only after
 writing all of the &lt;i&gt;r&lt;/i&gt; requested bytes.  Some types of channels,
 depending upon their state, may write only some of the bytes or possibly
 none at all.  A socket channel in non-blocking mode, for example, cannot
 write any more bytes than are free in the socket's output buffer.

 &lt;p&gt; This method may be invoked at any time.  If another thread has
 already initiated a write operation upon this channel, however, then an
 invocation of this method will block until the first operation is
 complete. &lt;/p&gt;
