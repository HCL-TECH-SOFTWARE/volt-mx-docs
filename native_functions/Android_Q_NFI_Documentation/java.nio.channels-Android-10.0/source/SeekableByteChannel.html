</span> implements java.nio.channels.ByteChannel

 A byte channel that maintains a current &lt;i&gt;position&lt;/i&gt; and allows the
 position to be changed.

 &lt;p&gt; A seekable byte channel is connected to an entity, typically a file,
 that contains a variable-length sequence of bytes that can be read and
 written. The current position can be {@link #position() &lt;i&gt;queried&lt;/i&gt;} and
 {@link #position(long) &lt;i&gt;modified&lt;/i&gt;}. The channel also provides access to
 the current &lt;i&gt;size&lt;/i&gt; of the entity to which the channel is connected. The
 size increases when bytes are written beyond its current size; the size
 decreases when it is {@link #truncate &lt;i&gt;truncated&lt;/i&gt;}.

 &lt;p&gt; The {@link #position(long) position} and {@link #truncate truncate} methods
 which do not otherwise have a value to return are specified to return the
 channel upon which they are invoked. This allows method invocations to be
 chained. Implementations of this interface should specialize the return type
 so that method invocations on the implementation class can be chained.

 &lt;p&gt; Setting the position to a value that is greater than the current size
 is legal but does not change the size of the entity.  A later attempt to
 read bytes at such a position will immediately return an end-of-file
 indication.  A later attempt to write bytes at such a position will cause
 the entity to grow to accommodate the new bytes; the values of any bytes
 between the previous end-of-file and the newly-written bytes are
 unspecified.

 &lt;p&gt; Setting the channel's position is not recommended when connected to
 an entity, typically a file, that is opened with the {@link java.nio.file.StandardOpenOption#APPEND APPEND} option. When opened for
 append, the position is first advanced to the end before writing.
