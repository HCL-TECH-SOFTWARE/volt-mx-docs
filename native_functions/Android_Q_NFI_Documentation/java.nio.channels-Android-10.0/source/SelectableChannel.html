</span> implements java.nio.channels.Channel

@extends java.nio.channels.spi.AbstractInterruptibleChannel

 A channel that can be multiplexed via a {@link java.nio.channels.Selector}.

 &lt;p&gt; In order to be used with a selector, an instance of this class must
 first be &lt;i&gt;registered&lt;/i&gt; via the {@link #register(Selector,int,Object)
 register} method.  This method returns a new {@link java.nio.channels.SelectionKey} object
 that represents the channel's registration with the selector.

 &lt;p&gt; Once registered with a selector, a channel remains registered until it
 is &lt;i&gt;deregistered&lt;/i&gt;.  This involves deallocating whatever resources were
 allocated to the channel by the selector.

 &lt;p&gt; A channel cannot be deregistered directly; instead, the key representing
 its registration must be &lt;i&gt;cancelled&lt;/i&gt;.  Cancelling a key requests that
 the channel be deregistered during the selector's next selection operation.
 A key may be cancelled explicitly by invoking its {@link java.nio.channels.SelectionKey#cancel() cancel} method.  All of a channel's keys are cancelled
 implicitly when the channel is closed, whether by invoking its {@link java.nio.channels.Channel#close close} method or by interrupting a thread blocked in an I/O
 operation upon the channel.

 &lt;p&gt; If the selector itself is closed then the channel will be deregistered,
 and the key representing its registration will be invalidated, without
 further delay.

 &lt;p&gt; A channel may be registered at most once with any particular selector.

 &lt;p&gt; Whether or not a channel is registered with one or more selectors may be
 determined by invoking the {@link #isRegistered isRegistered} method.

 &lt;p&gt; Selectable channels are safe for use by multiple concurrent
 threads. &lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;a name=&quot;bm&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;h2&gt;Blocking mode&lt;/h2&gt;

 A selectable channel is either in &lt;i&gt;blocking&lt;/i&gt; mode or in
 &lt;i&gt;non-blocking&lt;/i&gt; mode.  In blocking mode, every I/O operation invoked
 upon the channel will block until it completes.  In non-blocking mode an I/O
 operation will never block and may transfer fewer bytes than were requested
 or possibly no bytes at all.  The blocking mode of a selectable channel may
 be determined by invoking its {@link #isBlocking isBlocking} method.

 &lt;p&gt; Newly-created selectable channels are always in blocking mode.
 Non-blocking mode is most useful in conjunction with selector-based
 multiplexing.  A channel must be placed into non-blocking mode before being
 registered with a selector, and may not be returned to blocking mode until
 it has been deregistered.
