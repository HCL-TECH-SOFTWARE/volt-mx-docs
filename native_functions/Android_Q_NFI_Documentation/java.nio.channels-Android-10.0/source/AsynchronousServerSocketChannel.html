</span> implements java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannel

 implements java.nio.channels.NetworkChannel

@extends java.lang.Object

 An asynchronous channel for stream-oriented listening sockets.

 &lt;p&gt; An asynchronous server-socket channel is created by invoking the
 {@link #open open} method of this class.
 A newly-created asynchronous server-socket channel is open but not yet bound.
 It can be bound to a local address and configured to listen for connections
 by invoking the {@link #bind(SocketAddress,int) bind} method. Once bound,
 the {@link #accept(Object,CompletionHandler) accept} method
 is used to initiate the accepting of connections to the channel's socket.
 An attempt to invoke the &lt;tt&gt;accept&lt;/tt&gt; method on an unbound channel will
 cause a {@link java.nio.channels.NotYetBoundException} to be thrown.

 &lt;p&gt; Channels of this type are safe for use by multiple concurrent threads
 though at most one accept operation can be outstanding at any time.
 If a thread initiates an accept operation before a previous accept operation
 has completed then an {@link java.nio.channels.AcceptPendingException} will be thrown.

 &lt;p&gt; Socket options are configured using the {@link #setOption(SocketOption,Object)
 setOption} method. Channels of this type support the following options:
 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;table border summary=&quot;Socket options&quot;&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;th&gt;Option Name&lt;/th&gt;
     &lt;th&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_RCVBUF SO_RCVBUF} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; The size of the socket receive buffer &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; {@link java.net.StandardSocketOptions#SO_REUSEADDR SO_REUSEADDR} &lt;/td&gt;
     &lt;td&gt; Re-use address &lt;/td&gt;
   &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;
 Additional (implementation specific) options may also be supported.

 &lt;p&gt; &lt;b&gt;Usage Example:&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;pre&gt;
  final AsynchronousServerSocketChannel listener =
      AsynchronousServerSocketChannel.open().bind(new InetSocketAddress(5000));

  listener.accept(null, new CompletionHandler&amp;lt;AsynchronousSocketChannel,Void&amp;gt;() {
      public void completed(AsynchronousSocketChannel ch, Void att) {
          // accept the next connection
          listener.accept(null, this);

          // handle this connection
          handle(ch);
      }
      public void failed(Throwable exc, Void att) {
          ...
      }
  });
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; This method initiates an asynchronous operation to accept a
 connection made to this channel's socket. The {@code handler} parameter is
 a completion handler that is invoked when a connection is accepted (or
 the operation fails). The result passed to the completion handler is
 the {@link java.nio.channels.AsynchronousSocketChannel} to the new connection.

 &lt;p&gt; When a new connection is accepted then the resulting {@code
 AsynchronousSocketChannel} will be bound to the same {@link java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannelGroup} as this channel. If the group is {@link java.nio.channels.AsynchronousChannelGroup#isShutdown shutdown} and a connection is accepted,
 then the connection is closed, and the operation completes with an {@code
 IOException} and cause {@link java.nio.channels.ShutdownChannelGroupException}.

 &lt;p&gt; To allow for concurrent handling of new connections, the completion
 handler is not invoked directly by the initiating thread when a new
 connection is accepted immediately (see &lt;a

 by the security manager's {@link SecurityManager#checkAccept checkAccept}

 by the calling context of this method. If the permission check fails then
 the connection is closed and the operation completes with a {@link SecurityException}.
