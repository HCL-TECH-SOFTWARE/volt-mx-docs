</span> An interface for companion objects used to inspect views.

 Inspection companions only need to handle the properties and node name of the specific class
 they are defined for, not anything from a parent class. At runtime, the inspector instantiates
 one instance of each inspection companion, and handles visiting them in the correct inheritance
 order for each type it inspects.

 Properties are read from the top of the type tree to the bottom, so that classes that override
 a property in their parent class can overwrite it in the reader. In general, properties will
 cleanly inherit through their getters, and the inspector runtime will read the properties of a
 parent class via the parent's inspection companion, and the child companion will only read
 properties added or changed since the parent was defined.

</span>
 Each companion is responsible for storing the integer IDs of all its properties. This is the
 only method that is allowed to modify the stored IDs.

 Calling {@link #readProperties(T, android.view.inspector.PropertyReader)} before calling this results in
 undefined behavior.

 This method needs to return the property IDs stored by
 {@link #mapProperties}(PropertyMapper). Implementations should track if their properties
 have been mapped and throw a {@link android.view.inspector.InspectionCompanion.UninitializedPropertyMapException} if this method is
 called before {mapProperties}.
