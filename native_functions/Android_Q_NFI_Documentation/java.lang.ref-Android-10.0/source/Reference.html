 Abstract base class for reference objects.  This class defines the
 operations common to all reference objects.  Because reference objects are
 implemented in close cooperation with the garbage collector, this class may
 not be subclassed directly.

 reclaimable by garbage collection at least until after the invocation of
 this method.  Invocation of this method does not itself initiate garbage
 collection or finalization.

 with respect to garbage collection.  It controls relations that are
 otherwise only implicit in a program -- the reachability conditions
 triggering garbage collection.  This method is designed for use in
 uncommon situations of premature finalization where using
 {@code synchronized} blocks or methods, or using other synchronization
 facilities are not possible or do not provide the desired control.  This
 method is applicable only when reclamation may have visible effects,
 which is possible for objects with finalizers (See
 &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se8/html/jls-12.html#jls-12.6&quot;&gt;
 Section 12.6 17 of &lt;cite&gt;The Java&amp;trade; Language Specification&lt;/cite&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)
