 Weak reference objects, which do not prevent their referents from being
 made finalizable, finalized, and then reclaimed.  Weak references are most
 often used to implement canonicalizing mappings.

 &lt;p&gt; Suppose that the garbage collector determines at a certain point in time
 that an object is &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#reachability&quot;&gt;weakly
 reachable&lt;/a&gt;.  At that time it will atomically clear all weak references to
 that object and all weak references to any other weakly-reachable objects
 from which that object is reachable through a chain of strong and soft
 references.  At the same time it will declare all of the formerly
 weakly-reachable objects to be finalizable.  At the same time or at some
 later time it will enqueue those newly-cleared weak references that are
 registered with reference queues.
