 Soft reference objects, which are cleared at the discretion of the garbage
 collector in response to memory demand.

 &lt;p&gt; Suppose that the garbage collector determines at a certain point in time
 that an object is &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#reachability&quot;&gt;softly
 reachable&lt;/a&gt;.  At that time it may choose to clear atomically all soft
 references to that object and all soft references to any other
 softly-reachable objects from which that object is reachable through a chain
 of strong references.  At the same time or at some later time it will
 enqueue those newly-cleared soft references that are registered with
 reference queues.

 &lt;p&gt; All soft references to softly-reachable objects are guaranteed to have
 been cleared before the virtual machine throws an
 &lt;code&gt;OutOfMemoryError&lt;/code&gt;.  Otherwise no constraints are placed upon the
 time at which a soft reference will be cleared or the order in which a set
 of such references to different objects will be cleared.  Virtual machine
 implementations are, however, encouraged to bias against clearing
 recently-created or recently-used soft references.

 &lt;h3&gt;Avoid Soft References for Caching&lt;/h3&gt;
 In practice, soft references are inefficient for caching. The runtime doesn't
 have enough information on which references to clear and which to keep. Most
 fatally, it doesn't know what to do when given the choice between clearing a
 soft reference and growing the heap.

 &lt;p&gt;The lack of information on the value to your application of each reference
 limits the usefulness of soft references. References that are cleared too
 early cause unnecessary work; those that are cleared too late waste memory.

 &lt;p&gt;Most applications should use an {@code android.util.LruCache} instead of
 soft references. LruCache has an effective eviction policy and lets the user
 tune how much memory is allotted.
