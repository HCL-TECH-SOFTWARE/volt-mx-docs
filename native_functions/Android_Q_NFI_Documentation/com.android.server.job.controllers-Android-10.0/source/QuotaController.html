 Controller that tracks whether an app has exceeded its standby bucket quota.

 With initial defaults, each app in each bucket is given 10 minutes to run within its respective
 time window. Active jobs can run indefinitely, working set jobs can run for 10 minutes within a
 2 hour window, frequent jobs get to run 10 minutes in an 8 hour window, and rare jobs get to run
 10 minutes in a 24 hour window. The windows are rolling, so as soon as a job would have some
 quota based on its bucket, it will be eligible to run. When a job's bucket changes, its new
 quota is immediately applied to it.

 Job and session count limits are included to prevent abuse/spam. Each bucket has its own limit on
 the number of jobs or sessions that can run within the window. Regardless of bucket, apps will
 not be allowed to run more than 20 jobs within the past 10 minutes.

 Jobs are throttled while an app is not in a foreground state. All jobs are allowed to run
 freely when an app enters the foreground state and are restricted when the app leaves the
 foreground state. However, jobs that are started while the app is in the TOP state do not count
 towards any quota and are not restricted regardless of the app's state change.

 Jobs will not be throttled when the device is charging. The device is considered to be charging
 once the {@link BatteryManager#ACTION_CHARGING} intent has been broadcast.

 Note: all limits are enforced per bucket window unless explicitly stated otherwise.
 All stated values are configurable and subject to change. See {@link QcConstants} for current
 defaults.
