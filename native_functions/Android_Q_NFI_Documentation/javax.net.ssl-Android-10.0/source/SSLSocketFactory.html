 observe the inbound data but still create valid SSL/TLS

 (SNI) extensions (See section 3 of &lt;A

 using a {@link java.io.ByteArrayInputStream}.  When this
 {@link Socket} begins handshaking, it will read all of the data in
 {@code consumed} until it reaches {@code EOF}, then all further
 data is read from the underlying {@link InputStream} as
 usual.

 established for this factory, and is set to use server mode when
