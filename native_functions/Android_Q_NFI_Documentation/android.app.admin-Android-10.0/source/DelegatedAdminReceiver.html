 Base class for delegated apps to handle callbacks related to their delegated capabilities.

 &lt;p&gt;Delegated apps are apps that receive additional capabilities from the profile owner or
 device owner apps. Some of these capabilities involve the framework calling into the apps.
 To receive these callbacks, delegated apps should subclass this class and override the
 appropriate methods here. The subclassed receiver needs to be published in the app's
 manifest, with appropriate intent filters to mark which callbacks the receiver is interested
 in. An app can have multiple receivers as long as they listen for disjoint set of callbacks.
 For the manifest definitions, it must be protected by the
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN} permission to ensure only
 the system can trigger these callbacks.

 &lt;p&gt;The callback methods happen on the main thread of the process.  Thus long running
 operations must be done on another thread.  Note that because a receiver
 is done once returning from its onReceive function, such long-running operations
 should probably be done in a {@link Service}.
