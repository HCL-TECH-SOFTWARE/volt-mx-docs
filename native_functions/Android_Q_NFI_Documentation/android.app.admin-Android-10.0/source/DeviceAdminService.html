 Base class for a service that device owner/profile owners can optionally have.

 &lt;p&gt;The system searches for it with an intent filter with the
 {@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager#ACTION_DEVICE_ADMIN_SERVICE} action, and tries to keep a bound
 connection as long as the hosting user is running, so that the device/profile owner is always
 considered to be in the foreground.  This is useful to receive implicit broadcasts that
 can no longer be received by manifest receivers by apps targeting Android version
 {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#O}.  Device/profile owners can use a runtime-registered
 broadcast receiver instead, and have a {@link android.app.admin.DeviceAdminService} so that the process is always
 running.

 &lt;p&gt;Device/profile owners can use
 {@link android.content.pm.PackageManager#setComponentEnabledSetting(ComponentName, int, int)}
 to disable/enable its own service.  For example, when a device/profile owner no longer needs
 to be in the foreground, it can (and should) disable its service.

 &lt;p&gt;The service must be protected with the permission
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_DEVICE_ADMIN}.  Otherwise the system would ignore it.

 &lt;p&gt;When the owner process crashes, the service will be re-bound automatically after a
 back-off.

 &lt;p&gt;Note the process may still be killed if the system is under heavy memory pressure, in which
 case the process will be re-started later.
