 view hierarchy level of the RecyclerView before those touch events are considered for
 RecyclerView's own scrolling behavior.

 manipulation of item views within the RecyclerView. OnItemTouchListeners may intercept
 a touch interaction already in progress even if the RecyclerView is already handling that
 gesture stream itself for the purposes of scrolling.&lt;/p&gt;
