 This class defines the animations that take place on items as changes are made
 to the adapter.

 Subclasses of ItemAnimator can be used to implement custom animations for actions on
 ViewHolder items. The RecyclerView will manage retaining these items while they
 are being animated, but implementors must call {@link #dispatchAnimationFinished}(ViewHolder)
 when a ViewHolder's animation is finished. In other words, there must be a matching
 {@link #dispatchAnimationFinished}(ViewHolder) call for each
 {@link #animateAppearance(ViewHolder, com.android.internal.widget.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo, com.android.internal.widget.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo) animateAppearance()},
 {@link #animateChange(com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.ViewHolder, com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.ViewHolder, com.android.internal.widget.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo, com.android.internal.widget.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo)
 animateChange()}
 {@link #animatePersistence(ViewHolder, com.android.internal.widget.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo, com.android.internal.widget.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo) animatePersistence()},

 This means that the View was a child of the LayoutManager when layout started but has
 been removed by the LayoutManager. It might have been removed from the adapter or simply
 become invisible due to other factors. You can distinguish these two cases by checking
 the change flags that were passed to
 {@link #recordPreLayoutInformation(State, com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.ViewHolder, int, List)}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Note that when a ViewHolder both changes and disappears in the same layout pass, the
 animation callback method which will be called by the RecyclerView depends on the
 ItemAnimator's decision whether to re-use the same ViewHolder or not, and also the
 LayoutManager's decision whether to layout the changed version of a disappearing
 ViewHolder or not. RecyclerView will call
 {@link #animateChange(com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.ViewHolder, com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.ViewHolder, com.android.internal.widget.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo, com.android.internal.widget.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo)

 returns {@code false} from
 {@link #canReuseUpdatedViewHolder(ViewHolder) canReuseUpdatedViewHolder} and the
 LayoutManager lays out a new disappearing view that holds the updated information.
 Built-in LayoutManagers try to avoid laying out updated versions of disappearing views.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If LayoutManager supports predictive animations, it might provide a target disappear
 location for the View by laying it out in that location. When that happens,
 RecyclerView will call {@link #recordPostLayoutInformation(State, com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.ViewHolder)} and the
 response of that call will be passed to this method as the &lt;code&gt;postLayoutInfo&lt;/code&gt;.

 This ViewHolder still represents the same data that it was representing when the layout
 started but its position / size may be changed by the LayoutManager.

 If the Item's layout position didn't change, RecyclerView still calls this method because
 it does not track this information (or does not necessarily know that an animation is

</span> layout and RecyclerView has received a {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.Adapter#notifyItemChanged(int)} call
 for it. This method may also be called when
 {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.Adapter#notifyDataSetChanged()} is called and adapter has stable ids so that
 RecyclerView could still rebind views to the same ViewHolders. If viewType changes when
 {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.Adapter#notifyDataSetChanged()} is called, this method &lt;b&gt;will not&lt;/b&gt; be called,
 instead, {@link #animateAppearance(ViewHolder, com.android.internal.widget.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo, com.android.internal.widget.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo)} will be
 called for the new ViewHolder and the old one will be recycled.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If this method is called due to a {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.Adapter#notifyDataSetChanged()} call, there is
 a good possibility that item contents didn't really change but it is rebound from the
 adapter. {@link com.android.internal.widget.DefaultItemAnimator} will skip animating the View if its location on the
 screen didn't change and your animator should handle this case as well and avoid creating
 unnecessary animations.
 &lt;p&gt;
 When an item is updated, ItemAnimator has a chance to ask RecyclerView to keep the
 previous presentation of the item as-is and supply a new ViewHolder for the updated
 presentation (see: {@link #canReuseUpdatedViewHolder(ViewHolder, List)}.
 This is useful if you don't know the contents of the Item and would like
 to cross-fade the old and the new one ({@link com.android.internal.widget.DefaultItemAnimator} uses this technique).
 &lt;p&gt;
 When you are writing a custom item animator for your layout, it might be more performant
 and elegant to re-use the same ViewHolder and animate the content changes manually.
 &lt;p&gt;
 When {@link com.android.internal.widget.RecyclerView.Adapter#notifyItemChanged(int)} is called, the Item's view type may change.
 If the Item's view type has changed or ItemAnimator returned &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; for
 this ViewHolder when {@link #canReuseUpdatedViewHolder(ViewHolder, List)} was called, the
 &lt;code&gt;oldHolder&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;newHolder&lt;/code&gt; will be different ViewHolder instances
 which represent the same Item. In that case, only the new ViewHolder is visible
 to the LayoutManager but RecyclerView keeps old ViewHolder attached for animations.
 &lt;p&gt;
 ItemAnimator must call {@link #dispatchAnimationFinished}(ViewHolder) for each distinct
 ViewHolder when their animation is complete
 (or instantly call {@link #dispatchAnimationFinished}(ViewHolder) if it decides not to
 animate the view).
 &lt;p&gt;
  If oldHolder and newHolder are the same instance, you should call
 {@link #dispatchAnimationFinished}(ViewHolder) &lt;b&gt;only once&lt;/b&gt;.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Note that when a ViewHolder both changes and disappears in the same layout pass, the
 animation callback method which will be called by the RecyclerView depends on the
 ItemAnimator's decision whether to re-use the same ViewHolder or not, and also the
 LayoutManager's decision whether to layout the changed version of a disappearing
 ViewHolder or not. RecyclerView will call
 {@code animateChange} instead of
 {@link #animateDisappearance(ViewHolder, com.android.internal.widget.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo, com.android.internal.widget.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo)
 animateDisappearance} if and only if the ItemAnimator returns {@code false} from
 {@link #canReuseUpdatedViewHolder(ViewHolder) canReuseUpdatedViewHolder} and the
 LayoutManager lays out a new disappearing view that holds the updated information.
 Built-in LayoutManagers try to avoid laying out updated versions of disappearing views.
@param {Object {RecyclerView.ViewHolder}} oldHolder     The ViewHolder before the layout is started, might be the same
                      instance with newHolder.
@param {Object {RecyclerView.ViewHolder}} newHolder     The ViewHolder after the layout is finished, might be the same
