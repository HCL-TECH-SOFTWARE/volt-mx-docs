</span> The packer engine applies various transformations to the input JAR file,
 making the pack stream highly compressible by a compressor such as
 gzip or zip. An instance of the engine can be obtained
 using {@link #newPacker}.

 The high degree of compression is achieved
 by using a number of techniques described in the JSR 200 specification.
 Some of the techniques are sorting, re-ordering and co-location of the
 constant pool.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The pack engine is initialized to an initial state as described
 by their properties below.
 The initial state can be manipulated by getting the
 engine properties (using {@link #properties}) and storing
 the modified properties on the map.
 The resource files will be passed through with no changes at all.
 The class files will not contain identical bytes, since the unpacker
 is free to change minor class file features such as constant pool order.
 However, the class files will be semantically identical,
 as specified in
 &lt;cite&gt;The Java&amp;trade; Virtual Machine Specification&lt;/cite&gt;.
 &lt;p&gt;
 By default, the packer does not change the order of JAR elements.
 Also, the modification time and deflation hint of each
 JAR element is passed unchanged.
 (Any other ZIP-archive information, such as extra attributes
 giving Unix file permissions, are lost.)
 &lt;p&gt;
 Note that packing and unpacking a JAR will in general alter the
 bytewise contents of classfiles in the JAR.  This means that packing
 and unpacking will in general invalidate any digital signatures
 which rely on bytewise images of JAR elements.  In order both to sign
 and to pack a JAR, you must first pack and unpack the JAR to
 &quot;normalize&quot; it, then compute signatures on the unpacked JAR elements,
 and finally repack the signed JAR.
 Both packing steps should
 use precisely the same options, and the segment limit may also
 need to be set to &quot;-1&quot;, to prevent accidental variation of segment
 boundaries as class file sizes change slightly.
 &lt;p&gt;
 (Here's why this works:  Any reordering the packer does
 of any classfile structures is idempotent, so the second packing
 does not change the orderings produced by the first packing.
 Also, the unpacker is guaranteed by the JSR 200 specification
 to produce a specific bytewise image for any given transmission
 ordering of archive elements.)
 &lt;p&gt;
 In order to maintain backward compatibility, the pack file's version is
 set to accommodate the class files present in the input JAR file. In
 other words, the pack file version will be the latest, if the class files
 are the latest and conversely the pack file version will be the oldest
 if the class file versions are also the oldest. For intermediate class
 file versions the corresponding pack file version will be used.
 For example:
    If the input JAR-files are solely comprised of 1.5  (or  lesser)
 class files, a 1.5 compatible pack file is  produced. This will also be
 the case for archives that have no class files.
    If the input JAR-files contains a 1.6 class file, then the pack file
 version will be set to 1.6.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Note: Unless otherwise noted, passing a &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt; argument to a
 constructor or method in this class will cause a {@link NullPointerException}
 to be thrown.

<span id='java-util-jar-Pack200-Packer-property-SEGMENT_LIMIT'>/** This property is a numeral giving the estimated target size N
</span> (in bytes) of each archive segment.
 If a single input file requires more than N bytes,
 it will be given its own archive segment.
 &lt;p&gt;
 As a special case, a value of -1 will produce a single large
 segment with all input files, while a value of 0 will
 produce one segment for each class.
 Larger archive segments result in less fragmentation and
 better compression, but processing them requires more memory.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The size of each segment is estimated by counting the size of each
 input file to be transmitted in the segment, along with the size
 of its name and other transmitted properties.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The default is -1, which means the packer will always create a single
 segment output file. In cases where extremely large output files are
 generated, users are strongly encouraged to use segmenting or break
 up the input file into smaller JARs.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A 10Mb JAR packed without this limit will
 typically pack about 10% smaller, but the packer may require
 a larger Java heap (about ten times the segment limit).

 If it is set to {@link #FALSE}, the packer may reorder elements,
 and also remove JAR directory entries, which carry no useful
 information for Java applications.
 (Typically this enables better compression.)

 &lt;p&gt;
 The special value 0 instructs the packer to copy through the
 original JAR file directly, with no compression.  The JSR 200
 standard requires any unpacker to understand this special case
 as a pass-through of the entire archive.

 available element of the input archive, and transmit this hint separately.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The default is {@link #KEEP}, which preserves the input information,
 but may cause the transmitted archive to be larger than necessary.
 &lt;p&gt;
 It is up to the unpacker implementation

 the resulting unpacked jar.

 to all the entries in each segment, {@link #SEGMENT_LIMIT}.
