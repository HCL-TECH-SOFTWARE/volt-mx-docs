 stopping the job for you --
 you should not call {@link android.app.job.JobService#jobFinished(JobParameters, boolean)} yourself
 (otherwise you risk losing an upcoming JobWorkItem that is being enqueued at the same time).

 &lt;p&gt;Once you are done with the {@link android.app.job.JobWorkItem} returned by this method, you must call
 {@link #completeWork}(JobWorkItem) with it to inform the system that you are done
 executing the work.  The job will not be finished until all dequeued work has been
 completed.  You do not, however, have to complete each returned work item before deqeueing
 the next one -- you can use {@link #dequeueWork}() multiple times before completing
 previous work if you want to process work in parallel, and you can complete the work
 in whatever order you want.&lt;/p&gt;

 doing so any pending as well as remaining uncompleted work will be re-queued

      service}
@return {Object {android.app.job.JobWorkItem}} Returns a new {@link JobWorkItem} if there is one pending, otherwise null.
 If null is returned, the system will also stop the job if all work has also been completed.

 completed other work, to check either for more work or allow the system to stop the job.)
