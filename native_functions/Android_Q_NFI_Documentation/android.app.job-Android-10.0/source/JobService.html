 &lt;p&gt;Entry point for the callback from the {@link android.app.job.JobScheduler}.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This is the base class that handles asynchronous requests that were previously scheduled. You
 are responsible for overriding {@link android.app.job.JobService#onStartJob(JobParameters)}, which is where
 you will implement your job logic.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This service executes each incoming job on a {@link android.os.Handler} running on your
 application's main thread. This means that you &lt;b&gt;must&lt;/b&gt; offload your execution logic to
 another thread/handler/{@link android.os.AsyncTask} of your choosing. Not doing so will result
 in blocking any future callbacks from the JobManager - specifically
 {@link #onStopJob(android.app.job.JobParameters)}, which is meant to inform you that the
 scheduling requirements are no longer being met.&lt;/p&gt;

 You can request that the job be scheduled again by passing {@code true} as
 the &lt;code&gt;wantsReschedule&lt;/code&gt; parameter. This will apply back-off policy
 for the job; this policy can be adjusted through the
 {@link android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#setBackoffCriteria(long, int)} method
 when the job is originally scheduled.  The job's initial
 requirements are preserved when jobs are rescheduled, regardless of backed-off
 policy.
 &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;
 A job running while the device is dozing will not be rescheduled with the normal back-off
 policy.  Instead, the job will be re-added to the queue and executed again during
 a future idle maintenance window.

 on your application's main thread.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Return {@code true} from this method if your job needs to continue running.  If you
 do this, the job remains active until you call
 {@link #jobFinished(JobParameters, boolean)} to tell the system that it has completed
 its work, or until the job's required constraints are no longer satisfied.  For
 example, if the job was scheduled using
 {@link android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#setRequiresCharging(boolean) setRequiresCharging(true)},
 it will be immediately halted by the system if the user unplugs the device from power,
 the job's {@link #onStopJob}(JobParameters) callback will be invoked, and the app
 will be expected to shut down all ongoing work connected with that job.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The system holds a wakelock on behalf of your app as long as your job is executing.
 This wakelock is acquired before this method is invoked, and is not released until either
 you call {@link #jobFinished(JobParameters, boolean)}, or after the system invokes
 {@link #onStopJob}(JobParameters) to notify your job that it is being shut down
 prematurely.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Returning {@code false} from this method means your job is already finished.  The
 system's wakelock for the job will be released, and {@link #onStopJob}(JobParameters)
 will not be invoked.
@param {Object {JobParameters}} params Parameters specifying info about this job, including the optional
     extras configured with {@link JobInfo.Builder#setExtras(android.os.PersistableBundle).
     This object serves to identify this specific running job instance when calling
     {@link #jobFinished(JobParameters, boolean)}.
@return {Boolean} {@code true} if your service will continue running, using a separate thread
     when appropriate.  {@code false} means that this job has completed its work.

 &lt;p&gt;This will happen if the requirements specified at schedule time are no longer met. For
 example you may have requested WiFi with
 {@link android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#setRequiredNetworkType(int)}, yet while your
 job was executing the user toggled WiFi. Another example is if you had specified
 {@link android.app.job.JobInfo.Builder#setRequiresDeviceIdle(boolean)}, and the phone left its
 idle maintenance window. You are solely responsible for the behavior of your application
 upon receipt of this message; your app will likely start to misbehave if you ignore it.
