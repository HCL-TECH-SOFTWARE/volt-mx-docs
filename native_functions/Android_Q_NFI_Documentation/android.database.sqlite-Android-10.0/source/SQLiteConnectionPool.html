</span> implements java.io.Closeable

@extends java.lang.Object

 Maintains a pool of active SQLite database connections.
 &lt;p&gt;
 At any given time, a connection is either owned by the pool, or it has been
 acquired by a {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteSession}.  When the {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteSession} is
 finished with the connection it is using, it must return the connection
 back to the pool.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 The pool holds strong references to the connections it owns.  However,
 it only holds &lt;em&gt;weak references&lt;/em&gt; to the connections that sessions
 have acquired from it.  Using weak references in the latter case ensures
 that the connection pool can detect when connections have been improperly
 abandoned so that it can create new connections to replace them if needed.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 The connection pool is thread-safe (but the connections themselves are not).
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Exception safety&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 This code attempts to maintain the invariant that opened connections are
 always owned.  Unfortunately that means it needs to handle exceptions
 all over to ensure that broken connections get cleaned up.  Most
 operations invokving SQLite can throw {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteException} or other
 runtime exceptions.  This is a bit of a pain to deal with because the compiler
 cannot help us catch missing exception handling code.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 The general rule for this file: If we are making calls out to
 {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteConnection} then we must be prepared to handle any
 runtime exceptions it might throw at us.  Note that out-of-memory
 is an {@link Error}, not a {@link RuntimeException}.  We don't trouble ourselves
 handling out of memory because it is hard to do anything at all sensible then
 and most likely the VM is about to crash.
 &lt;/p&gt;
