</span> implements android.os.CancellationSignal.OnCancelListener

@extends java.lang.Object

 Represents a SQLite database connection.
 Each connection wraps an instance of a native &lt;code&gt;sqlite3&lt;/code&gt; object.
 &lt;p&gt;
 When database connection pooling is enabled, there can be multiple active
 connections to the same database.  Otherwise there is typically only one
 connection per database.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 When the SQLite WAL feature is enabled, multiple readers and one writer
 can concurrently access the database.  Without WAL, readers and writers
 are mutually exclusive.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Ownership and concurrency guarantees&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 Connection objects are not thread-safe.  They are acquired as needed to
 perform a database operation and are then returned to the pool.  At any
 given time, a connection is either owned and used by a {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteSession}
 object or the {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteConnectionPool}.  Those classes are
 responsible for serializing operations to guard against concurrent
 use of a connection.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 The guarantee of having a single owner allows this class to be implemented
 without locks and greatly simplifies resource management.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Encapsulation guarantees&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The connection object object owns *all* of the SQLite related native
 objects that are associated with the connection.  What's more, there are
 no other objects in the system that are capable of obtaining handles to
 those native objects.  Consequently, when the connection is closed, we do
 not have to worry about what other components might have references to
 its associated SQLite state -- there are none.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Encapsulation is what ensures that the connection object's
 lifecycle does not become a tortured mess of finalizers and reference
 queues.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h2&gt;Reentrance&lt;/h2&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 This class must tolerate reentrant execution of SQLite operations because
 triggers may call custom SQLite functions that perform additional queries.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 This method can be used to check for syntax errors during compilation
 prior to execution of the statement.  If the {@code outStatementInfo} argument
 is not null, the provided {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteStatementInfo} object is populated
 with information about the statement.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 A prepared statement makes no reference to the arguments that may eventually
 be bound to it, consequently it it possible to cache certain prepared statements
 such as SELECT or INSERT/UPDATE statements.  If the statement is cacheable,
 then it will be stored in the cache for later.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 To take advantage of this behavior as an optimization, the connection pool
 provides a method to acquire a connection that already has a given SQL statement
 in its prepared statement cache so that it is ready for execution.
