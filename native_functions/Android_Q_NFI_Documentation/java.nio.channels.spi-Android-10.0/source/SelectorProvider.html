</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Service-provider class for selectors and selectable channels.

 &lt;p&gt; A selector provider is a concrete subclass of this class that has a
 zero-argument constructor and implements the abstract methods specified
 below.  A given invocation of the Java virtual machine maintains a single
 system-wide default provider instance, which is returned by the {@link #provider() provider} method.  The first invocation of that method will locate
 the default provider as specified below.

 &lt;p&gt; The system-wide default provider is used by the static &lt;tt&gt;open&lt;/tt&gt;
 methods of the {@link java.nio.channels.DatagramChannel#open
 DatagramChannel}, {@link java.nio.channels.Pipe#open Pipe}, {@link java.nio.channels.Selector#open Selector}, {@link java.nio.channels.ServerSocketChannel#open ServerSocketChannel}, and {@link java.nio.channels.SocketChannel#open SocketChannel} classes.  It is also
 used by the {@link java.lang.System#inheritedChannel System.inheritedChannel()}
 method. A program may make use of a provider other than the default provider
 by instantiating that provider and then directly invoking the &lt;tt&gt;open&lt;/tt&gt;
 methods defined in this class.

 &lt;p&gt; All of the methods in this class are safe for use by multiple concurrent
 threads.  &lt;/p&gt;

<span id='java-nio-channels-spi-SelectorProvider-method-provider'>/**Returns the system-wide default selector provider for this invocation of
</span> the Java virtual machine.

 &lt;p&gt; The first invocation of this method locates the default provider
 object as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;ol&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the system property
   &lt;tt&gt;java.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider&lt;/tt&gt; is defined then it is
   taken to be the fully-qualified name of a concrete provider class.
   The class is loaded and instantiated; if this process fails then an
   unspecified error is thrown.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; If a provider class has been installed in a jar file that is
   visible to the system class loader, and that jar file contains a
   provider-configuration file named
   &lt;tt&gt;java.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider&lt;/tt&gt; in the resource
   directory &lt;tt&gt;META-INF/services&lt;/tt&gt;, then the first class name
   specified in that file is taken.  The class is loaded and
   instantiated; if this process fails then an unspecified error is
   thrown.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, if no provider has been specified by any of the above
   means then the system-default provider class is instantiated and the
   result is returned.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;/ol&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; Subsequent invocations of this method return the provider that was
 returned by the first invocation.  &lt;/p&gt;

</span> Java virtual machine.

 &lt;p&gt; On many operating systems a process, such as a Java virtual
 machine, can be started in a manner that allows the process to
 inherit a channel from the entity that created the process. The
 manner in which this is done is system dependent, as are the
 possible entities to which the channel may be connected. For example,
 on UNIX systems, the Internet services daemon (&lt;i&gt;inetd&lt;/i&gt;) is used to
 start programs to service requests when a request arrives on an
 associated network port. In this example, the process that is started,
 inherits a channel representing a network socket.

 &lt;p&gt; In cases where the inherited channel represents a network socket
 then the {@link java.nio.channels.Channel Channel} type returned
 by this method is determined as follows:

 &lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the inherited channel represents a stream-oriented connected
  socket then a {@link java.nio.channels.SocketChannel SocketChannel} is
  returned. The socket channel is, at least initially, in blocking
  mode, bound to a socket address, and connected to a peer.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the inherited channel represents a stream-oriented listening
  socket then a {@link java.nio.channels.ServerSocketChannel
  ServerSocketChannel} is returned. The server-socket channel is, at
  least initially, in blocking mode, and bound to a socket address.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; If the inherited channel is a datagram-oriented socket
  then a {@link java.nio.channels.DatagramChannel DatagramChannel} is
  returned. The datagram channel is, at least initially, in blocking
  mode, and bound to a socket address.
  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; In addition to the network-oriented channels described, this method
 may return other kinds of channels in the future.

 &lt;p&gt; The first invocation of this method creates the channel that is
 returned. Subsequent invocations of this method return the same
 channel. &lt;/p&gt;
