</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 An AudioGroup is an audio hub for the speaker, the microphone, and
 {@link android.net.rtp.AudioStream}s. Each of these components can be logically turned on
 or off by calling {@link #setMode}(int) or {@link android.net.rtp.RtpStream#setMode(int)}.
 The AudioGroup will go through these components and process them one by one
 within its execution loop. The loop consists of four steps. First, for each
 AudioStream not in {@link android.net.rtp.RtpStream#MODE_SEND_ONLY}, decodes its incoming
 packets and stores in its buffer. Then, if the microphone is enabled,
 processes the recorded audio and stores in its buffer. Third, if the speaker
 is enabled, mixes all AudioStream buffers and plays back. Finally, for each
 AudioStream not in {@link android.net.rtp.RtpStream#MODE_RECEIVE_ONLY}, mixes all other
 buffers and sends back the encoded packets. An AudioGroup does nothing if
 there is no AudioStream in it.

 &lt;p&gt;Few things must be noticed before using these classes. The performance is
 highly related to the system load and the network bandwidth. Usually a
 simpler {@link android.net.rtp.AudioCodec} costs fewer CPU cycles but requires more network
 bandwidth, and vise versa. Using two AudioStreams at the same time doubles
 not only the load but also the bandwidth. The condition varies from one
 device to another, and developers should choose the right combination in
 order to get the best result.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;It is sometimes useful to keep multiple AudioGroups at the same time. For
 example, a Voice over IP (VoIP) application might want to put a conference
 call on hold in order to make a new call but still allow people in the
 conference call talking to each other. This can be done easily using two
 AudioGroups, but there are some limitations. Since the speaker and the
 microphone are globally shared resources, only one AudioGroup at a time is
 allowed to run in a mode other than {@link #MODE_ON_HOLD}. The others will
 be unable to acquire these resources and fail silently.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Using this class requires
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#RECORD_AUDIO} permission. Developers
 should set the audio mode to {@link AudioManager#MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION}
 using {@link AudioManager#setMode(int)} and change it back when none of
 the AudioGroups is in use.&lt;/p&gt;
