 An AudioStream is a {@link android.net.rtp.RtpStream} which carrys audio payloads over
 Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP). Two different classes are developed in
 order to support various usages such as audio conferencing. An AudioStream
 represents a remote endpoint which consists of a network mapping and a
 configured {@link android.net.rtp.AudioCodec}. On the other side, An {@link android.net.rtp.AudioGroup}
 represents a local endpoint which mixes all the AudioStreams and optionally
 interacts with the speaker and the microphone at the same time. The simplest
 usage includes one for each endpoints. For other combinations, developers
 should be aware of the limitations described in {@link android.net.rtp.AudioGroup}.

 &lt;p&gt;An AudioStream becomes busy when it joins an AudioGroup. In this case most
 of the setter methods are disabled. This is designed to ease the task of
 managing native resources. One can always make an AudioStream leave its
 AudioGroup by calling {@link #join}(AudioGroup) with {@code null} and put it
 back after the modification is done.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Using this class requires
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#INTERNET} permission.&lt;/p&gt;
