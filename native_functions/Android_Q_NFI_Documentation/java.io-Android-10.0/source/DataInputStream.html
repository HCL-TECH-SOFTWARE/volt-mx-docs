@extends java.io.FilterInputStream

 A data input stream lets an application read primitive Java data
 types from an underlying input stream in a machine-independent
 way. An application uses a data output stream to write data that
 can later be read by a data input stream.
 &lt;p&gt;
 DataInputStream is not necessarily safe for multithreaded access.
 Thread safety is optional and is the responsibility of users of
 methods in this class.
