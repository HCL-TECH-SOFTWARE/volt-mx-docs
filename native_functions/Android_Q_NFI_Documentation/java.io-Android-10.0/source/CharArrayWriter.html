 This class implements a character buffer that can be used as an Writer.
 The buffer automatically grows when data is written to the stream.  The data
 can be retrieved using toCharArray() and toString().
 &lt;P&gt;
 Note: Invoking close() on this class has no effect, and methods
 of this class can be called after the stream has closed
 without generating an IOException.
