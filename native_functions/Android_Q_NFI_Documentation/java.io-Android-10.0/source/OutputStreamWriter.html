 An OutputStreamWriter is a bridge from character streams to byte streams:
 Characters written to it are encoded into bytes using a specified {@link java.nio.charset.Charset charset}.  The charset that it uses
 may be specified by name or may be given explicitly, or the platform's
 default charset may be accepted.

 &lt;p&gt; Each invocation of a write() method causes the encoding converter to be
 invoked on the given character(s).  The resulting bytes are accumulated in a
 buffer before being written to the underlying output stream.  The size of
 this buffer may be specified, but by default it is large enough for most
 purposes.  Note that the characters passed to the write() methods are not
 buffered.

 &lt;p&gt; For top efficiency, consider wrapping an OutputStreamWriter within a
 BufferedWriter so as to avoid frequent converter invocations.  For example:

 &lt;pre&gt;
 Writer out
   = new BufferedWriter(new OutputStreamWriter(System.out));
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; A &lt;i&gt;surrogate pair&lt;/i&gt; is a character represented by a sequence of two
 &lt;tt&gt;char&lt;/tt&gt; values: A &lt;i&gt;high&lt;/i&gt; surrogate in the range '&amp;#92;uD800' to
 '&amp;#92;uDBFF' followed by a &lt;i&gt;low&lt;/i&gt; surrogate in the range '&amp;#92;uDC00' to
 '&amp;#92;uDFFF'.

 &lt;p&gt; A &lt;i&gt;malformed surrogate element&lt;/i&gt; is a high surrogate that is not
 followed by a low surrogate or a low surrogate that is not preceded by a
 high surrogate.

 &lt;p&gt; This class always replaces malformed surrogate elements and unmappable
 character sequences with the charset's default &lt;i&gt;substitution sequence&lt;/i&gt;.
 The {@linkplain java.nio.charset.CharsetEncoder} class should be used when more
 control over the encoding process is required.
