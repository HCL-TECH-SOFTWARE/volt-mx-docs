</span> implements java.io.ObjectInput

 implements java.io.ObjectStreamConstants

@extends java.io.InputStream

 An ObjectInputStream deserializes primitive data and objects previously
 written using an ObjectOutputStream.

 &lt;p&gt;ObjectOutputStream and ObjectInputStream can provide an application with
 persistent storage for graphs of objects when used with a FileOutputStream
 and FileInputStream respectively.  ObjectInputStream is used to recover
 those objects previously serialized. Other uses include passing objects
 between hosts using a socket stream or for marshaling and unmarshaling
 arguments and parameters in a remote communication system.

 &lt;p&gt;ObjectInputStream ensures that the types of all objects in the graph
 created from the stream match the classes present in the Java Virtual
 Machine.  Classes are loaded as required using the standard mechanisms.

 &lt;p&gt;Only objects that support the java.io.Serializable or
 java.io.Externalizable interface can be read from streams.

 &lt;p&gt;The method &lt;code&gt;readObject&lt;/code&gt; is used to read an object from the
 stream.  Java's safe casting should be used to get the desired type.  In
 Java, strings and arrays are objects and are treated as objects during
 serialization. When read they need to be cast to the expected type.

 &lt;p&gt;Primitive data types can be read from the stream using the appropriate
 method on DataInput.

 &lt;p&gt;The default deserialization mechanism for objects restores the contents
 of each field to the value and type it had when it was written.  Fields
 declared as transient or static are ignored by the deserialization process.
 References to other objects cause those objects to be read from the stream
 as necessary.  Graphs of objects are restored correctly using a reference
 sharing mechanism.  New objects are always allocated when deserializing,
 which prevents existing objects from being overwritten.

 &lt;p&gt;Reading an object is analogous to running the constructors of a new
 object.  Memory is allocated for the object and initialized to zero (NULL).
 No-arg constructors are invoked for the non-serializable classes and then
 the fields of the serializable classes are restored from the stream starting
 with the serializable class closest to java.lang.object and finishing with
 the object's most specific class.

 &lt;p&gt;For example to read from a stream as written by the example in
 ObjectOutputStream:
 &lt;br&gt;
 &lt;pre&gt;
      FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(&quot;t.tmp&quot;);
      ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(fis);

      int i = ois.readInt();
      String today = (String) ois.readObject();
      Date date = (Date) ois.readObject();

      ois.close();
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Classes control how they are serialized by implementing either the
 java.io.Serializable or java.io.Externalizable interfaces.

 &lt;p&gt;Implementing the Serializable interface allows object serialization to
 save and restore the entire state of the object and it allows classes to
 evolve between the time the stream is written and the time it is read.  It
 automatically traverses references between objects, saving and restoring
 entire graphs.

 &lt;p&gt;Serializable classes that require special handling during the
 serialization and deserialization process should implement the following
 methods:

 &lt;pre&gt;
 private void writeObject(java.io.ObjectOutputStream stream)
     throws IOException;
 private void readObject(java.io.ObjectInputStream stream)
     throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException;
 private void readObjectNoData()
     throws ObjectStreamException;
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The readObject method is responsible for reading and restoring the state
 of the object for its particular class using data written to the stream by
 the corresponding writeObject method.  The method does not need to concern
 itself with the state belonging to its superclasses or subclasses.  State is
 restored by reading data from the ObjectInputStream for the individual
 fields and making assignments to the appropriate fields of the object.
 Reading primitive data types is supported by DataInput.

 &lt;p&gt;Any attempt to read object data which exceeds the boundaries of the
 custom data written by the corresponding writeObject method will cause an
 OptionalDataException to be thrown with an eof field value of true.
 Non-object reads which exceed the end of the allotted data will reflect the
 end of data in the same way that they would indicate the end of the stream:
 bytewise reads will return -1 as the byte read or number of bytes read, and
 primitive reads will throw EOFExceptions.  If there is no corresponding
 writeObject method, then the end of default serialized data marks the end of
 the allotted data.

 &lt;p&gt;Primitive and object read calls issued from within a readExternal method
 behave in the same manner--if the stream is already positioned at the end of
 data written by the corresponding writeExternal method, object reads will
 throw OptionalDataExceptions with eof set to true, bytewise reads will
 return -1, and primitive reads will throw EOFExceptions.  Note that this
 behavior does not hold for streams written with the old
 &lt;code&gt;ObjectStreamConstants.PROTOCOL_VERSION_1&lt;/code&gt; protocol, in which the
 end of data written by writeExternal methods is not demarcated, and hence
 cannot be detected.

 &lt;p&gt;The readObjectNoData method is responsible for initializing the state of
 the object for its particular class in the event that the serialization
 stream does not list the given class as a superclass of the object being
 deserialized.  This may occur in cases where the receiving party uses a
 different version of the deserialized instance's class than the sending
 party, and the receiver's version extends classes that are not extended by
 the sender's version.  This may also occur if the serialization stream has
 been tampered; hence, readObjectNoData is useful for initializing
 deserialized objects properly despite a &quot;hostile&quot; or incomplete source
 stream.

 &lt;p&gt;Serialization does not read or assign values to the fields of any object
 that does not implement the java.io.Serializable interface.  Subclasses of
 Objects that are not serializable can be serializable. In this case the
 non-serializable class must have a no-arg constructor to allow its fields to
 be initialized.  In this case it is the responsibility of the subclass to
 save and restore the state of the non-serializable class. It is frequently
 the case that the fields of that class are accessible (public, package, or
 protected) or that there are get and set methods that can be used to restore
 the state.

 &lt;p&gt;Any exception that occurs while deserializing an object will be caught by
 the ObjectInputStream and abort the reading process.

 &lt;p&gt;Implementing the Externalizable interface allows the object to assume
 complete control over the contents and format of the object's serialized
 form.  The methods of the Externalizable interface, writeExternal and
 readExternal, are called to save and restore the objects state.  When
 implemented by a class they can write and read their own state using all of
 the methods of ObjectOutput and ObjectInput.  It is the responsibility of
 the objects to handle any versioning that occurs.

 &lt;p&gt;Enum constants are deserialized differently than ordinary serializable or
 externalizable objects.  The serialized form of an enum constant consists
 solely of its name; field values of the constant are not transmitted.  To
 deserialize an enum constant, ObjectInputStream reads the constant name from
 the stream; the deserialized constant is then obtained by calling the static
 method &lt;code&gt;Enum.valueOf(Class, String)&lt;/code&gt; with the enum constant's
 base type and the received constant name as arguments.  Like other
 serializable or externalizable objects, enum constants can function as the
 targets of back references appearing subsequently in the serialization
 stream.  The process by which enum constants are deserialized cannot be
 customized: any class-specific readObject, readObjectNoData, and readResolve
 methods defined by enum types are ignored during deserialization.
 Similarly, any serialPersistentFields or serialVersionUID field declarations
 are also ignored--all enum types have a fixed serialVersionUID of 0L.

 Default deserializing for a class can be overridden using the writeObject

 transitively so that a complete equivalent graph of objects is

</span> identical to readObject, except that it prevents subsequent calls to
 readObject and readUnshared from returning additional references to the
 deserialized instance obtained via this call.  Specifically:
 &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;If readUnshared is called to deserialize a back-reference (the
       stream representation of an object which has been written
       previously to the stream), an ObjectStreamException will be
       thrown.

   &lt;li&gt;If readUnshared returns successfully, then any subsequent attempts
       to deserialize back-references to the stream handle deserialized
       by readUnshared will cause an ObjectStreamException to be thrown.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 Deserializing an object via readUnshared invalidates the stream handle
 associated with the returned object.  Note that this in itself does not
 always guarantee that the reference returned by readUnshared is unique;
 the deserialized object may define a readResolve method which returns an
 object visible to other parties, or readUnshared may return a Class
 object or enum constant obtainable elsewhere in the stream or through
 external means. If the deserialized object defines a readResolve method
 and the invocation of that method returns an array, then readUnshared
 returns a shallow clone of that array; this guarantees that the returned
 array object is unique and cannot be obtained a second time from an
 invocation of readObject or readUnshared on the ObjectInputStream,
 even if the underlying data stream has been manipulated.
