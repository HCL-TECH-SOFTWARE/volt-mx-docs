 A character stream that collects its output in a string buffer, which can
 then be used to construct a string.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Closing a &lt;tt&gt;StringWriter&lt;/tt&gt; has no effect. The methods in this class
 can be called after the stream has been closed without generating an
 &lt;tt&gt;IOException&lt;/tt&gt;.
