</span> implements java.io.Serializable

 Only the identity of the class of an Externalizable instance is
 written in the serialization stream and it is the responsibility
 of the class to save and restore the contents of its instances.

 The writeExternal and readExternal methods of the Externalizable
 interface are implemented by a class to give the class complete
 control over the format and contents of the stream for an object
 and its supertypes. These methods must explicitly
 coordinate with the supertype to save its state. These methods supersede
 customized implementations of writeObject and readObject methods.&lt;br&gt;

 Object Serialization uses the Serializable and Externalizable
 interfaces.  Object persistence mechanisms can use them as well.  Each
 object to be stored is tested for the Externalizable interface. If
 the object supports Externalizable, the writeExternal method is called. If the
 object does not support Externalizable and does implement
 Serializable, the object is saved using
 ObjectOutputStream. &lt;br&gt; When an Externalizable object is
 reconstructed, an instance is created using the public no-arg
 constructor, then the readExternal method called.  Serializable
 objects are restored by reading them from an ObjectInputStream.&lt;br&gt;

 An Externalizable instance can designate a substitution object via
 the writeReplace and readResolve methods documented in the Serializable
 interface.&lt;br&gt;
