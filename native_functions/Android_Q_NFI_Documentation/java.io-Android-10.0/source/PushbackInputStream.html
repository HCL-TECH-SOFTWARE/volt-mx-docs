 A &lt;code&gt;PushbackInputStream&lt;/code&gt; adds
 functionality to another input stream, namely
 the  ability to &quot;push back&quot; or &quot;unread&quot;
 one byte. This is useful in situations where
 it is  convenient for a fragment of code
 to read an indefinite number of data bytes
 that  are delimited by a particular byte
 value; after reading the terminating byte,
 the  code fragment can &quot;unread&quot; it, so that
 the next read operation on the input stream
 will reread the byte that was pushed back.
 For example, bytes representing the  characters
 constituting an identifier might be terminated
 by a byte representing an  operator character;
 a method whose job is to read just an identifier
 can read until it  sees the operator and
 then push the operator back to be re-read.
