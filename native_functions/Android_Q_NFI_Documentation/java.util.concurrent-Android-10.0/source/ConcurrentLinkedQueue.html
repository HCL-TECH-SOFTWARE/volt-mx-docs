</span> implements java.util.Queue

 implements java.io.Serializable

@extends java.util.AbstractQueue

 An unbounded thread-safe {@linkplain Queue queue} based on linked nodes.
 This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out).
 The &lt;em&gt;head&lt;/em&gt; of the queue is that element that has been on the
 queue the longest time.
 The &lt;em&gt;tail&lt;/em&gt; of the queue is that element that has been on the
 queue the shortest time. New elements
 are inserted at the tail of the queue, and the queue retrieval
 operations obtain elements at the head of the queue.
 A {@code ConcurrentLinkedQueue} is an appropriate choice when
 many threads will share access to a common collection.
 Like most other concurrent collection implementations, this class
 does not permit the use of {@code null} elements.

 &lt;p&gt;This implementation employs an efficient &lt;em&gt;non-blocking&lt;/em&gt;
 algorithm based on one described in
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.cs.rochester.edu/~scott/papers/1996_PODC_queues.pdf&quot;&gt;
 Simple, Fast, and Practical Non-Blocking and Blocking Concurrent Queue
 Algorithms&lt;/a&gt; by Maged M. Michael and Michael L. Scott.

 &lt;p&gt;Iterators are &lt;i&gt;weakly consistent&lt;/i&gt;, returning elements
 reflecting the state of the queue at some point at or since the
 creation of the iterator.  They do &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; throw {@link java.util.ConcurrentModificationException}, and may proceed concurrently
 with other operations.  Elements contained in the queue since the creation
 of the iterator will be returned exactly once.

 &lt;p&gt;Beware that, unlike in most collections, the {@code size} method
 is &lt;em&gt;NOT&lt;/em&gt; a constant-time operation. Because of the
 asynchronous nature of these queues, determining the current number
 of elements requires a traversal of the elements, and so may report
 inaccurate results if this collection is modified during traversal.
 Additionally, the bulk operations {@code addAll},
 {@code removeAll}, {@code retainAll}, {@code containsAll},
 {@code equals}, and {@code toArray} are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; guaranteed
 to be performed atomically. For example, an iterator operating
 concurrently with an {@code addAll} operation might view only some
 of the added elements.

 &lt;p&gt;This class and its iterator implement all of the &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt;
 methods of the {@link Queue} and {@link Iterator} interfaces.

 &lt;p&gt;Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent
 collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a
 {@code ConcurrentLinkedQueue}
 &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from
 the {@code ConcurrentLinkedQueue} in another thread.
