</span>@extends java.util.concurrent.AbstractExecutorService

 An {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} that executes each submitted task using
 one of possibly several pooled threads, normally configured
 using {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors} factory methods.

 &lt;p&gt;Thread pools address two different problems: they usually
 provide improved performance when executing large numbers of
 asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation overhead,
 and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources,
 including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks.
 Each {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} also maintains some basic
 statistics, such as the number of completed tasks.

 &lt;p&gt;To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class
 provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility
 hooks. However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient
 {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors} factory methods {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors#newCachedThreadPool} (unbounded thread pool, with
 automatic thread reclamation), {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors#newFixedThreadPool}
 (fixed size thread pool) and {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors#newSingleThreadExecutor} (single background thread), that
 preconfigure settings for the most common usage
 scenarios. Otherwise, use the following guide when manually
 configuring and tuning this class:

 &lt;dl&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;Core and maximum pool sizes&lt;/dt&gt;

 &lt;dd style=&quot;font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;
 A {@code ThreadPoolExecutor} will automatically adjust the
 pool size (see {@link #getPoolSize})
 according to the bounds set by
 corePoolSize (see {@link #getCorePoolSize}) and
 maximumPoolSize (see {@link #getMaximumPoolSize}).

 When a new task is submitted in method {@link #execute}(Runnable),
 and fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, a new thread is
 created to handle the request, even if other worker threads are
 idle.  If there are more than corePoolSize but less than
 maximumPoolSize threads running, a new thread will be created only
 if the queue is full.  By setting corePoolSize and maximumPoolSize
 the same, you create a fixed-size thread pool. By setting
 maximumPoolSize to an essentially unbounded value such as {@code
 Integer.MAX_VALUE}, you allow the pool to accommodate an arbitrary
 number of concurrent tasks. Most typically, core and maximum pool
 sizes are set only upon construction, but they may also be changed
 dynamically using {@link #setCorePoolSize} and {@link #setMaximumPoolSize}. &lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;On-demand construction&lt;/dt&gt;

 &lt;dd style=&quot;font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;
 By default, even core threads are initially created and
 started only when new tasks arrive, but this can be overridden
 dynamically using method {@link #prestartCoreThread} or {@link #prestartAllCoreThreads}.  You probably want to prestart threads if
 you construct the pool with a non-empty queue. &lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;Creating new threads&lt;/dt&gt;

 &lt;dd style=&quot;font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;
 New threads are created using a {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory}.  If not
 otherwise specified, a {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors#defaultThreadFactory} is
 used, that creates threads to all be in the same {@link ThreadGroup} and with the same {@code NORM_PRIORITY} priority and
 non-daemon status. By supplying a different ThreadFactory, you can
 alter the thread's name, thread group, priority, daemon status,
 etc. If a {@code ThreadFactory} fails to create a thread when asked
 by returning null from {@code newThread}, the executor will
 continue, but might not be able to execute any tasks. Threads
 should possess the &quot;modifyThread&quot; {@code RuntimePermission}. If
 worker threads or other threads using the pool do not possess this
 permission, service may be degraded: configuration changes may not
 take effect in a timely manner, and a shutdown pool may remain in a
 state in which termination is possible but not completed.&lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;Keep-alive times&lt;/dt&gt;

 &lt;dd style=&quot;font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;
 If the pool currently has more than corePoolSize threads,
 excess threads will be terminated if they have been idle for more
 than the keepAliveTime (see {@link #getKeepAliveTime}(TimeUnit)).
 This provides a means of reducing resource consumption when the
 pool is not being actively used. If the pool becomes more active
 later, new threads will be constructed. This parameter can also be
 changed dynamically using method {@link #setKeepAliveTime(long,
 java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit)}.  Using a value of {@code Long.MAX_VALUE} {@link java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit#NANOSECONDS} effectively disables idle threads from ever
 terminating prior to shut down. By default, the keep-alive policy
 applies only when there are more than corePoolSize threads, but
 method {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut}(boolean) can be used to
 apply this time-out policy to core threads as well, so long as the
 keepAliveTime value is non-zero. &lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;Queuing&lt;/dt&gt;

 &lt;dd style=&quot;font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;
 Any {@link java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue} may be used to transfer and hold
 submitted tasks.  The use of this queue interacts with pool sizing:

 &lt;ul&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor
 always prefers adding a new thread
 rather than queuing.

 &lt;li&gt;If corePoolSize or more threads are running, the Executor
 always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new
 thread.

 &lt;li&gt;If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless
 this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task will be
 rejected.

 &lt;/ul&gt;

 There are three general strategies for queuing:
 &lt;ol&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt; Direct handoffs.&lt;/em&gt; A good default choice for a work
 queue is a {@link java.util.concurrent.SynchronousQueue} that hands off tasks to threads
 without otherwise holding them. Here, an attempt to queue a task
 will fail if no threads are immediately available to run it, so a
 new thread will be constructed. This policy avoids lockups when
 handling sets of requests that might have internal dependencies.
 Direct handoffs generally require unbounded maximumPoolSizes to
 avoid rejection of new submitted tasks. This in turn admits the
 possibility of unbounded thread growth when commands continue to
 arrive on average faster than they can be processed.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt; Unbounded queues.&lt;/em&gt; Using an unbounded queue (for
 example a {@link java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue} without a predefined
 capacity) will cause new tasks to wait in the queue when all
 corePoolSize threads are busy. Thus, no more than corePoolSize
 threads will ever be created. (And the value of the maximumPoolSize
 therefore doesn't have any effect.)  This may be appropriate when
 each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot
 affect each others execution; for example, in a web page server.
 While this style of queuing can be useful in smoothing out
 transient bursts of requests, it admits the possibility of
 unbounded work queue growth when commands continue to arrive on
 average faster than they can be processed.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bounded queues.&lt;/em&gt; A bounded queue (for example, an
 {@link java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue}) helps prevent resource exhaustion when
 used with finite maximumPoolSizes, but can be more difficult to
 tune and control.  Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes may be traded
 off for each other: Using large queues and small pools minimizes
 CPU usage, OS resources, and context-switching overhead, but can
 lead to artificially low throughput.  If tasks frequently block (for
 example if they are I/O bound), a system may be able to schedule
 time for more threads than you otherwise allow. Use of small queues
 generally requires larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but
 may encounter unacceptable scheduling overhead, which also
 decreases throughput.

 &lt;/ol&gt;

 &lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;Rejected tasks&lt;/dt&gt;

 &lt;dd style=&quot;font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;
 New tasks submitted in method {@link #execute}(Runnable) will be
 &lt;em&gt;rejected&lt;/em&gt; when the Executor has been shut down, and also when
 the Executor uses finite bounds for both maximum threads and work queue
 capacity, and is saturated.  In either case, the {@code execute} method
 invokes the {@link java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionHandler#rejectedExecution(Runnable, ThreadPoolExecutor)}
 method of its {@link java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionHandler}.  Four predefined handler
 policies are provided:

 &lt;ol&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;In the default {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy}, the
 handler throws a runtime {@link java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException} upon
 rejection.

 &lt;li&gt;In {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy}, the thread
 that invokes {@code execute} itself runs the task. This provides a
 simple feedback control mechanism that will slow down the rate that
 new tasks are submitted.

 &lt;li&gt;In {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy}, a task that
 cannot be executed is simply dropped.

 &lt;li&gt;In {@link java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy}, if the
 executor is not shut down, the task at the head of the work queue
 is dropped, and then execution is retried (which can fail again,
 causing this to be repeated.)

 &lt;/ol&gt;

 It is possible to define and use other kinds of {@link java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionHandler} classes. Doing so requires some care
 especially when policies are designed to work only under particular
 capacity or queuing policies. &lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;Hook methods&lt;/dt&gt;

 &lt;dd style=&quot;font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;
 This class provides {@code protected} overridable
 {@link #beforeExecute(Thread, Runnable)} and
 {@link #afterExecute(Runnable, Throwable)} methods that are called
 before and after execution of each task.  These can be used to
 manipulate the execution environment; for example, reinitializing
 ThreadLocals, gathering statistics, or adding log entries.
 Additionally, method {@link #terminated} can be overridden to perform
 any special processing that needs to be done once the Executor has
 fully terminated.

 &lt;p&gt;If hook, callback, or BlockingQueue methods throw exceptions,
 internal worker threads may in turn fail, abruptly terminate, and
 possibly be replaced.&lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;Queue maintenance&lt;/dt&gt;

 &lt;dd style=&quot;font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;
 Method {@link #getQueue}() allows access to the work queue
 for purposes of monitoring and debugging.  Use of this method for
 any other purpose is strongly discouraged.  Two supplied methods,
 {@link #remove}(Runnable) and {@link #purge} are available to
 assist in storage reclamation when large numbers of queued tasks
 become cancelled.&lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;dt&gt;Finalization&lt;/dt&gt;

 &lt;dd style=&quot;font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;
 A pool that is no longer referenced in a program &lt;em&gt;AND&lt;/em&gt;
 has no remaining threads will be {@code shutdown} automatically. If
 you would like to ensure that unreferenced pools are reclaimed even
 if users forget to call {@link #shutdown}, then you must arrange
 that unused threads eventually die, by setting appropriate
 keep-alive times, using a lower bound of zero core threads and/or
 setting {@link #allowCoreThreadTimeOut}(boolean).  &lt;/dd&gt;

 &lt;/dl&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Extension example&lt;/b&gt;. Most extensions of this class
 override one or more of the protected hook methods. For example,
 here is a subclass that adds a simple pause/resume feature:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class PausableThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor {
   private boolean isPaused;
   private ReentrantLock pauseLock = new ReentrantLock();
   private Condition unpaused = pauseLock.newCondition();

   public PausableThreadPoolExecutor(...) { super(...); }

   protected void beforeExecute(Thread t, Runnable r) {
     super.beforeExecute(t, r);
     pauseLock.lock();
     try {
       while (isPaused) unpaused.await();
     } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
       t.interrupt();
     } finally {
       pauseLock.unlock();
     }
   }

   public void pause() {
     pauseLock.lock();
     try {
       isPaused = true;
     } finally {
       pauseLock.unlock();
     }
   }

   public void resume() {
     pauseLock.lock();
     try {
       isPaused = false;
       unpaused.signalAll();
     } finally {
       pauseLock.unlock();
     }
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;
