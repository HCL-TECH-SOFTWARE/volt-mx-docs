</span> implements java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService

 An {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} that can schedule commands to run after a given
 delay, or to execute periodically.

 &lt;p&gt;The {@code schedule} methods create tasks with various delays
 and return a task object that can be used to cancel or check
 execution. The {@code scheduleAtFixedRate} and
 {@code scheduleWithFixedDelay} methods create and execute tasks
 that run periodically until cancelled.

 &lt;p&gt;Commands submitted using the {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor#execute(Runnable)}
 and {@link java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService} {@code submit} methods are scheduled
 with a requested delay of zero. Zero and negative delays (but not
 periods) are also allowed in {@code schedule} methods, and are
 treated as requests for immediate execution.

 &lt;p&gt;All {@code schedule} methods accept &lt;em&gt;relative&lt;/em&gt; delays and
 periods as arguments, not absolute times or dates. It is a simple
 matter to transform an absolute time represented as a {@link java.util.Date} to the required form. For example, to schedule at
 a certain future {@code date}, you can use: {@code schedule(task,
 date.getTime() - System.currentTimeMillis(),
 TimeUnit.MILLISECONDS)}. Beware however that expiration of a
 relative delay need not coincide with the current {@code Date} at
 which the task is enabled due to network time synchronization
 protocols, clock drift, or other factors.

 &lt;p&gt;The {@link java.util.concurrent.Executors} class provides convenient factory methods for
 the ScheduledExecutorService implementations provided in this package.

 &lt;h3&gt;Usage Example&lt;/h3&gt;

 Here is a class with a method that sets up a ScheduledExecutorService
 to beep every ten seconds for an hour:

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 import static java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit.*;
 class BeeperControl {
   private final ScheduledExecutorService scheduler =
     Executors.newScheduledThreadPool(1);

   public void beepForAnHour() {
     final Runnable beeper = new Runnable() {
       public void run() { System.out.println(&quot;beep&quot;); }
     };
     final ScheduledFuture&lt;?&gt; beeperHandle =
       scheduler.scheduleAtFixedRate(beeper, 10, 10, SECONDS);
     scheduler.schedule(new Runnable() {
       public void run() { beeperHandle.cancel(true); }
     }, 60 * 60, SECONDS);
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;
