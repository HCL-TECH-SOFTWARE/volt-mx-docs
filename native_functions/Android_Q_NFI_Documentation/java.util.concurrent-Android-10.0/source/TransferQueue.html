</span> implements java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue

 A {@link java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue} in which producers may wait for consumers
 to receive elements.  A {@code TransferQueue} may be useful for
 example in message passing applications in which producers
 sometimes (using method {@link #transfer}) await receipt of
 elements by consumers invoking {@code take} or {@code poll}, while
 at other times enqueue elements (via method {@code put}) without
 waiting for receipt.
 {@linkplain #tryTransfer(Object) Non-blocking} and
 {@linkplain #tryTransfer(Object,long,TimeUnit) time-out} versions of
 {@code tryTransfer} are also available.
 A {@code TransferQueue} may also be queried, via {@link #hasWaitingConsumer}, whether there are any threads waiting for
 items, which is a converse analogy to a {@code peek} operation.

 &lt;p&gt;Like other blocking queues, a {@code TransferQueue} may be
 capacity bounded.  If so, an attempted transfer operation may
 initially block waiting for available space, and/or subsequently
 block waiting for reception by a consumer.  Note that in a queue
 with zero capacity, such as {@link java.util.concurrent.SynchronousQueue}, {@code put}
 and {@code transfer} are effectively synonymous.
