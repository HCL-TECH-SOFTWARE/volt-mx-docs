</span> A stage of a possibly asynchronous computation, that performs an
 action or computes a value when another CompletionStage completes.
 A stage completes upon termination of its computation, but this may
 in turn trigger other dependent stages.  The functionality defined
 in this interface takes only a few basic forms, which expand out to
 a larger set of methods to capture a range of usage styles:

 &lt;ul&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;The computation performed by a stage may be expressed as a
 Function, Consumer, or Runnable (using methods with names including
 &lt;em&gt;apply&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;accept&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;run&lt;/em&gt;, respectively)
 depending on whether it requires arguments and/or produces results.
 For example:
 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 stage.thenApply(x -&gt; square(x))
      .thenAccept(x -&gt; System.out.print(x))
      .thenRun(() -&gt; System.out.println());}&lt;/pre&gt;

 An additional form (&lt;em&gt;compose&lt;/em&gt;) allows the construction of
 computation pipelines from functions returning completion stages.

 &lt;p&gt;Any argument to a stage's computation is the outcome of a
 triggering stage's computation.

 &lt;li&gt;One stage's execution may be triggered by completion of a
 single stage, or both of two stages, or either of two stages.
 Dependencies on a single stage are arranged using methods with
 prefix &lt;em&gt;then&lt;/em&gt;. Those triggered by completion of
 &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of two stages may &lt;em&gt;combine&lt;/em&gt; their results or
 effects, using correspondingly named methods. Those triggered by
 &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; of two stages make no guarantees about which of the
 results or effects are used for the dependent stage's computation.

 &lt;li&gt;Dependencies among stages control the triggering of
 computations, but do not otherwise guarantee any particular
 ordering. Additionally, execution of a new stage's computations may
 be arranged in any of three ways: default execution, default
 asynchronous execution (using methods with suffix &lt;em&gt;async&lt;/em&gt;
 that employ the stage's default asynchronous execution facility),
 or custom (via a supplied {@link java.util.concurrent.Executor}).  The execution
 properties of default and async modes are specified by
 CompletionStage implementations, not this interface. Methods with
 explicit Executor arguments may have arbitrary execution
 properties, and might not even support concurrent execution, but
 are arranged for processing in a way that accommodates asynchrony.

 &lt;li&gt;Two method forms ({@link #handle handle} and {@link #whenComplete whenComplete}) support unconditional computation
 whether the triggering stage completed normally or exceptionally.
 Method {@link #exceptionally exceptionally} supports computation
 only when the triggering stage completes exceptionally, computing a
 replacement result, similarly to the java {@code catch} keyword.
 In all other cases, if a stage's computation terminates abruptly
 with an (unchecked) exception or error, then all dependent stages
 requiring its completion complete exceptionally as well, with a
 {@link java.util.concurrent.CompletionException} holding the exception as its cause.  If
 a stage is dependent on &lt;em&gt;both&lt;/em&gt; of two stages, and both
 complete exceptionally, then the CompletionException may correspond
 to either one of these exceptions.  If a stage is dependent on
 &lt;em&gt;either&lt;/em&gt; of two others, and only one of them completes
 exceptionally, no guarantees are made about whether the dependent
 stage completes normally or exceptionally. In the case of method
 {@code whenComplete}, when the supplied action itself encounters an
 exception, then the stage completes exceptionally with this
 exception unless the source stage also completed exceptionally, in
 which case the exceptional completion from the source stage is
 given preference and propagated to the dependent stage.

 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All methods adhere to the above triggering, execution, and
 exceptional completion specifications (which are not repeated in
 individual method specifications). Additionally, while arguments
 used to pass a completion result (that is, for parameters of type
 {@code T}) for methods accepting them may be null, passing a null
 value for any other parameter will result in a {@link NullPointerException} being thrown.

 &lt;p&gt;Method form {@link #handle handle} is the most general way of
 creating a continuation stage, unconditionally performing a
 computation that is given both the result and exception (if any) of
 the triggering CompletionStage, and computing an arbitrary result.
 Method {@link #whenComplete whenComplete} is similar, but preserves
 the result of the triggering stage instead of computing a new one.
 Because a stage's normal result may be {@code null}, both methods
 should have a computation structured thus:

 &lt;pre&gt;{@code (result, exception) -&gt; {
   if (exception == null) {
     // triggering stage completed normally
   } else {
     // triggering stage completed exceptionally
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This interface does not define methods for initially creating,
 forcibly completing normally or exceptionally, probing completion
 status or results, or awaiting completion of a stage.
 Implementations of CompletionStage may provide means of achieving
 such effects, as appropriate.  Method {@link #toCompletableFuture}
 enables interoperability among different implementations of this
 interface by providing a common conversion type.
