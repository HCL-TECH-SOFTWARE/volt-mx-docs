</span> implements java.io.Serializable

@extends java.lang.Object

 A counting semaphore.  Conceptually, a semaphore maintains a set of
 permits.  Each {@link #acquire} blocks if necessary until a permit is
 available, and then takes it.  Each {@link #release} adds a permit,
 potentially releasing a blocking acquirer.
 However, no actual permit objects are used; the {@code Semaphore} just
 keeps a count of the number available and acts accordingly.

 &lt;p&gt;Semaphores are often used to restrict the number of threads than can
 access some (physical or logical) resource. For example, here is
 a class that uses a semaphore to control access to a pool of items:
 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class Pool {
   private static final int MAX_AVAILABLE = 100;
   private final Semaphore available = new Semaphore(MAX_AVAILABLE, true);

   public Object getItem() throws InterruptedException {
     available.acquire();
     return getNextAvailableItem();
   }

   public void putItem(Object x) {
     if (markAsUnused(x))
       available.release();
   }

   // Not a particularly efficient data structure; just for demo

   protected Object[] items = ... whatever kinds of items being managed
   protected boolean[] used = new boolean[MAX_AVAILABLE];

   protected synchronized Object getNextAvailableItem() {
     for (int i = 0; i &lt; MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
       if (!used[i]) {
          used[i] = true;
          return items[i];
       }
     }
     return null; // not reached
   }

   protected synchronized boolean markAsUnused(Object item) {
     for (int i = 0; i &lt; MAX_AVAILABLE; ++i) {
       if (item == items[i]) {
          if (used[i]) {
            used[i] = false;
            return true;
          } else
            return false;
       }
     }
     return false;
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Before obtaining an item each thread must acquire a permit from
 the semaphore, guaranteeing that an item is available for use. When
 the thread has finished with the item it is returned back to the
 pool and a permit is returned to the semaphore, allowing another
 thread to acquire that item.  Note that no synchronization lock is
 held when {@link #acquire} is called as that would prevent an item
 from being returned to the pool.  The semaphore encapsulates the
 synchronization needed to restrict access to the pool, separately
 from any synchronization needed to maintain the consistency of the
 pool itself.

 &lt;p&gt;A semaphore initialized to one, and which is used such that it
 only has at most one permit available, can serve as a mutual
 exclusion lock.  This is more commonly known as a &lt;em&gt;binary
 semaphore&lt;/em&gt;, because it only has two states: one permit
 available, or zero permits available.  When used in this way, the
 binary semaphore has the property (unlike many {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock}
 implementations), that the &amp;quot;lock&amp;quot; can be released by a
 thread other than the owner (as semaphores have no notion of
 ownership).  This can be useful in some specialized contexts, such
 as deadlock recovery.

 &lt;p&gt;The constructor for this class optionally accepts a
 &lt;em&gt;fairness&lt;/em&gt; parameter. When set false, this class makes no
 guarantees about the order in which threads acquire permits. In
 particular, &lt;em&gt;barging&lt;/em&gt; is permitted, that is, a thread
 invoking {@link #acquire} can be allocated a permit ahead of a
 thread that has been waiting - logically the new thread places itself at
 the head of the queue of waiting threads. When fairness is set true, the
 semaphore guarantees that threads invoking any of the {@link #acquire() acquire} methods are selected to obtain permits in the order in
 which their invocation of those methods was processed
 (first-in-first-out; FIFO). Note that FIFO ordering necessarily
 applies to specific internal points of execution within these
 methods.  So, it is possible for one thread to invoke
 {@code acquire} before another, but reach the ordering point after
 the other, and similarly upon return from the method.
 Also note that the untimed {@link #tryAcquire() tryAcquire} methods do not
 honor the fairness setting, but will take any permits that are
 available.

 &lt;p&gt;Generally, semaphores used to control resource access should be
 initialized as fair, to ensure that no thread is starved out from
 accessing a resource. When using semaphores for other kinds of
 synchronization control, the throughput advantages of non-fair
 ordering often outweigh fairness considerations.

 &lt;p&gt;This class also provides convenience methods to {@link #acquire(int) acquire} and {@link #release(int) release} multiple
 permits at a time. These methods are generally more efficient and
 effective than loops. However, they do not establish any preference
 order. For example, if thread A invokes {@code s.acquire(3}) and
 thread B invokes {@code s.acquire(2)}, and two permits become
 available, then there is no guarantee that thread B will obtain
 them unless its acquire came first and Semaphore {@code s} is in
 fair mode.

 &lt;p&gt;Memory consistency effects: Actions in a thread prior to calling
 a &quot;release&quot; method such as {@code release()}
 &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#MemoryVisibility&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;happen-before&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 actions following a successful &quot;acquire&quot; method such as {@code acquire()}
 in another thread.
