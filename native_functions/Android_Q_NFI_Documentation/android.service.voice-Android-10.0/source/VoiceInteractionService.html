 Top-level service of the current global voice interactor, which is providing
 support for hotwording, the back-end of a {@link android.app.VoiceInteractor}, etc.
 The current VoiceInteractionService that has been selected by the user is kept
 always running by the system, to allow it to do things like listen for hotwords
 in the background to instigate voice interactions.

 &lt;p&gt;Because this service is always running, it should be kept as lightweight as
 possible.  Heavy-weight operations (including showing UI) should be implemented
 in the associated {@link android.service.voice.VoiceInteractionSessionService} when
 an actual voice interaction is taking place, and that service should run in a
 separate process from this one.
