 Provides access to data about how various system resources are used by applications.
 @more
 &lt;p&gt;
 If you are going to be using this class to log your application's resource usage,
 please consider the amount of resources (battery, network, etc) that will be used
 by the logging itself.  It can be substantial.
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;b&gt;Battery Usage&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
 Since Android version {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#Q}, the statistics related to power
 (battery) usage are recorded since the device was last considered fully charged (for previous
 versions, it is instead since the device was last unplugged).
 It is expected that applications schedule more work to do while the device is
 plugged in (e.g. using {@link android.app.job.JobScheduler JobScheduler}), and
 while that can affect charging rates, it is still preferable to actually draining
 the battery.
