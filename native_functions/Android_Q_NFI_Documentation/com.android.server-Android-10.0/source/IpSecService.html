 A service to manage multiple clients that want to access the IpSec API. The service is
 responsible for maintaining a list of clients and managing the resources (and related quotas)
 that each of them own.

 &lt;p&gt;Synchronization in IpSecService is done on all entrypoints due to potential race conditions at
 the kernel/xfrm level. Further, this allows the simplifying assumption to be made that only one
 thread is ever running at a time.
