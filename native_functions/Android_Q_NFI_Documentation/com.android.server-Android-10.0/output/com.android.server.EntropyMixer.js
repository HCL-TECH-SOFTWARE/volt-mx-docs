Applications which\n depend strongly on randomness may find {@code /dev/random} or\n {@code /dev/urandom} returning predictable data.  In order to counteract\n this effect, it's helpful to carry the entropy pool information across\n shutdowns and startups.</p>\n\n<p> <p>On systems with Hardware RNG (/dev/hw_random), a block of output from HW\n RNG is mixed into the Linux RNG on EntropyMixer's startup and whenever\n EntropyMixer periodically runs to save a block of output from Linux RNG on\n disk. This mixing is done in a way that does not increase the Linux RNG's\n entropy estimate is not increased.
