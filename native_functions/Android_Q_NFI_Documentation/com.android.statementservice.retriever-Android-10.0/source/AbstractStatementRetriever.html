 Retrieves the statements made by assets. This class is the entry point of the package.
 &lt;p&gt;
 An asset is an identifiable and addressable online entity that typically
 provides some service or content. Examples of assets are websites, Android
 apps, Twitter feeds, and Plus Pages.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Ownership of an asset is defined by being able to control it and speak for it.
 An asset owner may establish a relationship between the asset and another
 asset by making a statement about an intended relationship between the two.
 An example of a relationship is permission delegation. For example, the owner
 of a website (the webmaster) may delegate the ability the handle URLs to a
 particular mobile app. Relationships are considered public information.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A particular kind of relationship (like permission delegation) defines a binary
 relation on assets. The relation is not symmetric or transitive, nor is it
 antisymmetric or anti-transitive.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A statement S(r, a, b) is an assertion that the relation r holds for the
 ordered pair of assets (a, b). For example, taking r = &quot;delegates permission
 to view user's location&quot;, a = New York Times mobile app,
 b = nytimes.com website, S(r, a, b) would be an assertion that &quot;the New York
 Times mobile app delegates its ability to use the user's location to the
 nytimes.com website&quot;.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A statement S(r, a, b) is considered &lt;b&gt;reliable&lt;/b&gt; if we have confidence that
 the statement is true; the exact criterion depends on the kind of statement,
 since some kinds of statements may be true on their face whereas others may
 require multiple parties to agree.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For example, to get the statements made by www.example.com use:
 &lt;pre&gt;
 result = retrieveStatements(AssetFactory.create(
     &quot;{\&quot;namespace\&quot;: \&quot;web\&quot;, \&quot;site\&quot;: \&quot;https://www.google.com\&quot;}&quot;))
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 {@code result} will contain the statements and the expiration time of this result. The statements
 are considered reliable until the expiration time.

 &lt;p&gt; For web assets, {@link com.android.statementservice.retriever.AbstractStatementRetriever} will try to retrieve the statement
 file from URL: {@code [webAsset.site]/.well-known/assetlinks.json&quot;} where {@code
 [webAsset.site]} is in the form {@code http{s}://[hostname]:[optional_port]}. The file
 should contain one JSON array of statements.

 &lt;p&gt; For Android assets, {@link com.android.statementservice.retriever.AbstractStatementRetriever} will try to retrieve the statement
 from the AndroidManifest.xml. The developer should add a {@code meta-data} tag under
 {@code application} tag where attribute {@code android:name} equals &quot;associated_assets&quot;
 and {@code android:recourse} points to a string array resource. Each entry in the string
 array should contain exactly one statement in JSON format. Note that this implementation
 can only return statements made by installed apps.
