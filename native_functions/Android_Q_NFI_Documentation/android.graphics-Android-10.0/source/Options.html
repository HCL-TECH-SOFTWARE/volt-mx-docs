var Options = {

<span id='android-graphics-BitmapFactory-Options-property-inBitmap'>/** If set, decode methods that take the Options object will attempt to
</span> reuse this bitmap when loading content. If the decode operation
 cannot use this bitmap, the decode method will throw an
 {@link java.lang.IllegalArgumentException}. The
 current implementation necessitates that the reused bitmap be
 mutable, and the resulting reused bitmap will continue to remain
 mutable even when decoding a resource which would normally result in
 an immutable bitmap.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;You should still always use the returned Bitmap of the decode
 method and not assume that reusing the bitmap worked, due to the
 constraints outlined above and failure situations that can occur.
 Checking whether the return value matches the value of the inBitmap
 set in the Options structure will indicate if the bitmap was reused,
 but in all cases you should use the Bitmap returned by the decoding
 function to ensure that you are using the bitmap that was used as the
 decode destination.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;Usage with BitmapFactory&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As of {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT}, any
 mutable bitmap can be reused by {@link android.graphics.BitmapFactory} to decode any
 other bitmaps as long as the resulting {@link android.graphics.Bitmap#getByteCount()
 byte count} of the decoded bitmap is less than or equal to the {@link android.graphics.Bitmap#getAllocationByteCount() allocated byte count} of the reused
 bitmap. This can be because the intrinsic size is smaller, or its
 size post scaling (for density / sample size) is smaller.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Prior to {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT}
 additional constraints apply: The image being decoded (whether as a
 resource or as a stream) must be in jpeg or png format. Only equal
 sized bitmaps are supported, with {@link #inSampleSize} set to 1.
 Additionally, the {@link android.graphics.Bitmap.Config
 configuration} of the reused bitmap will override the setting of
 {@link #inPreferredConfig}, if set.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;Usage with BitmapRegionDecoder&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;BitmapRegionDecoder will draw its requested content into the Bitmap
 provided, clipping if the output content size (post scaling) is larger
 than the provided Bitmap. The provided Bitmap's width, height, and
 {@link android.graphics.Bitmap.Config} will not be changed.

 &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;BitmapRegionDecoder support for {@link #inBitmap} was
 introduced in {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#JELLY_BEAN}. All
 formats supported by BitmapRegionDecoder support Bitmap reuse via
 {@link #inBitmap}.&lt;/p&gt;

 In {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT} and below, if this

 pixels such that they can be purged if the system needs to reclaim
 memory. In that instance, when the pixels need to be accessed again
 (e.g. the bitmap is drawn, getPixels() is called), they will be
 automatically re-decoded.

 &lt;p&gt;For the re-decode to happen, the bitmap must have access to the
 encoded data, either by sharing a reference to the input
 or by making a copy of it. This distinction is controlled by
 inInputShareable. If this is true, then the bitmap may keep a shallow
 reference to the input. If this is false, then the bitmap will
 explicitly make a copy of the input data, and keep that. Even if
 sharing is allowed, the implementation may still decide to make a
 deep copy of the input data.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;While inPurgeable can help avoid big Dalvik heap allocations (from
 API level 11 onward), it sacrifices performance predictability since any
 image that the view system tries to draw may incur a decode delay which
 can lead to dropped frames. Therefore, most apps should avoid using
 inPurgeable to allow for a fast and fluid UI. To minimize Dalvik heap
 allocations use the {@link #inBitmap} flag instead.&lt;/p&gt;
