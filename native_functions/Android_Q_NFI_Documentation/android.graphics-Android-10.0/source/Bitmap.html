</span> Bitmap pixel data is not re-initialized for the new configuration.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This method can be used to avoid allocating a new bitmap, instead
 reusing an existing bitmap's allocation for a new configuration of equal
 or lesser size. If the Bitmap's allocation isn't large enough to support
 the new configuration, an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown and the
 bitmap will not be modified.&lt;/p&gt;

 the new bitmap will always be considered opaque. When converting from 565,
 the new bitmap will be considered non-opaque, and will respect the value
 set by setPremultiplied().&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;WARNING: This method should NOT be called on a bitmap currently in use
 by the view system, Canvas, or the AndroidBitmap NDK API. It does not
 make guarantees about how the underlying pixel buffer is remapped to the
 new config, just that the allocation is reused. Additionally, the view
 system does not account for bitmap properties being modifying during use,
 e.g. while attached to drawables.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In order to safely ensure that a Bitmap is no longer in use by the
 View system it is necessary to wait for a draw pass to occur after
 invalidate()'ing any view that had previously drawn the Bitmap in the last
 draw pass due to hardware acceleration's caching of draw commands. As
 an example, here is how this can be done for an ImageView:
 &lt;pre class=&quot;prettyprint&quot;&gt;
      ImageView myImageView = ...;
      final Bitmap myBitmap = ...;
      myImageView.setImageDrawable(null);

              // myBitmap is now no longer in use by the ImageView

              myBitmap.reconfigure(...);
