 The Canvas class holds the &quot;draw&quot; calls. To draw something, you need
 4 basic components: A Bitmap to hold the pixels, a Canvas to host
 the draw calls (writing into the bitmap), a drawing primitive (e.g. Rect,
 Path, text, Bitmap), and a paint (to describe the colors and styles for the
 drawing).

 The run of text includes the characters from {@code start} to {@code end} in the text. In
 addition, the range {@code contextStart} to {@code contextEnd} is used as context for the
 purpose of complex text shaping, such as Arabic text potentially shaped differently based on
 the text next to it.
 &lt;p&gt;
 All text outside the range {@code contextStart..contextEnd} is ignored. The text between
 {@code start} and {@code end} will be laid out and drawn. The context range is useful for
 contextual shaping, e.g. Kerning, Arabic contextural form.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The direction of the run is explicitly specified by {@code isRtl}. Thus, this method is
 suitable only for runs of a single direction. Alignment of the text is as determined by the
 Paint's TextAlign value. Further, {@code 0 &lt;= contextStart &lt;= start &lt;= end &lt;= contextEnd
 &lt;= text.length} must hold on entry.
