 Captures frames from an image stream as an OpenGL ES texture.

 &lt;p&gt;The image stream may come from either camera preview or video decode. A
 {@link android.view.Surface} created from a SurfaceTexture can be used as an output
 destination for the {@link android.hardware.camera2}, {@link android.media.MediaCodec},
 {@link android.media.MediaPlayer}, and {@link android.renderscript.Allocation} APIs.
 When {@link #updateTexImage} is called, the contents of the texture object specified
 when the SurfaceTexture was created are updated to contain the most recent image from the image
 stream.  This may cause some frames of the stream to be skipped.

 &lt;p&gt;A SurfaceTexture may also be used in place of a SurfaceHolder when specifying the output
 destination of the older {@link android.hardware.Camera} API. Doing so will cause all the
 frames from the image stream to be sent to the SurfaceTexture object rather than to the device's
 display.

 &lt;p&gt;When sampling from the texture one should first transform the texture coordinates using the
 matrix queried via {@link #getTransformMatrix(float[])}.  The transform matrix may change each
 time {@link #updateTexImage} is called, so it should be re-queried each time the texture image
 is updated.
 This matrix transforms traditional 2D OpenGL ES texture coordinate column vectors of the form (s,
 t, 0, 1) where s and t are on the inclusive interval [0, 1] to the proper sampling location in
 the streamed texture.  This transform compensates for any properties of the image stream source
 that cause it to appear different from a traditional OpenGL ES texture.  For example, sampling
 from the bottom left corner of the image can be accomplished by transforming the column vector
 (0, 0, 0, 1) using the queried matrix, while sampling from the top right corner of the image can
 be done by transforming (1, 1, 0, 1).

 &lt;p&gt;The texture object uses the GL_TEXTURE_EXTERNAL_OES texture target, which is defined by the
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/extensions/OES/OES_EGL_image_external.txt&quot;&gt;
 GL_OES_EGL_image_external&lt;/a&gt; OpenGL ES extension.  This limits how the texture may be used.
 Each time the texture is bound it must be bound to the GL_TEXTURE_EXTERNAL_OES target rather than
 the GL_TEXTURE_2D target.  Additionally, any OpenGL ES 2.0 shader that samples from the texture
 must declare its use of this extension using, for example, an &quot;#extension
 GL_OES_EGL_image_external : require&quot; directive.  Such shaders must also access the texture using
 the samplerExternalOES GLSL sampler type.

 &lt;p&gt;SurfaceTexture objects may be created on any thread.  {@link #updateTexImage} may only be
 called on the thread with the OpenGL ES context that contains the texture object.  The
 frame-available callback is called on an arbitrary thread, so unless special care is taken {@link #updateTexImage} should not be called directly from the callback.

 offsets between subsequent frames.&lt;/p&gt;
