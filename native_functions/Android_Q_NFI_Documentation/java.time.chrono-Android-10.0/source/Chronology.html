</span> implements java.lang.Comparable

 A calendar system, used to organize and identify dates.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The main date and time API is built on the ISO calendar system.
 The chronology operates behind the scenes to represent the general concept of a calendar system.
 For example, the Japanese, Minguo, Thai Buddhist and others.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Most other calendar systems also operate on the shared concepts of year, month and day,
 linked to the cycles of the Earth around the Sun, and the Moon around the Earth.
 These shared concepts are defined by {@link ChronoField} and are available
 for use by any {@code Chronology} implementation:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   LocalDate isoDate = ...
   ThaiBuddhistDate thaiDate = ...
   int isoYear = isoDate.get(ChronoField.YEAR);
   int thaiYear = thaiDate.get(ChronoField.YEAR);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 As shown, although the date objects are in different calendar systems, represented by different
 {@code Chronology} instances, both can be queried using the same constant on {@code ChronoField}.
 For a full discussion of the implications of this, see {@link java.time.chrono.ChronoLocalDate}.
 In general, the advice is to use the known ISO-based {@code LocalDate}, rather than
 {@code ChronoLocalDate}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 While a {@code Chronology} object typically uses {@code ChronoField} and is based on
 an era, year-of-era, month-of-year, day-of-month model of a date, this is not required.
 A {@code Chronology} instance may represent a totally different kind of calendar system,
 such as the Mayan.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In practical terms, the {@code Chronology} instance also acts as a factory.
 The {@link #of}(String) method allows an instance to be looked up by identifier,
 while the {@link #ofLocale}(Locale) method allows lookup by locale.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@code Chronology} instance provides a set of methods to create {@code ChronoLocalDate} instances.
 The date classes are used to manipulate specific dates.
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #dateNow() dateNow()}
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #dateNow(Clock) dateNow(clock)}
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #dateNow(ZoneId) dateNow(zone)}
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #date(int, int, int) date(yearProleptic, month, day)}
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #date(Era, int, int, int) date(era, yearOfEra, month, day)}
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #dateYearDay(int, int) dateYearDay(yearProleptic, dayOfYear)}
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #dateYearDay(Era, int, int) dateYearDay(era, yearOfEra, dayOfYear)}
 &lt;li&gt; {@link #date(TemporalAccessor) date(TemporalAccessor)}
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;h3 id=&quot;addcalendars&quot;&gt;Adding New Calendars&lt;/h3&gt;
 The set of available chronologies can be extended by applications.
 Adding a new calendar system requires the writing of an implementation of
 {@code Chronology}, {@code ChronoLocalDate} and {@code Era}.
 The majority of the logic specific to the calendar system will be in the
 {@code ChronoLocalDate} implementation.
 The {@code Chronology} implementation acts as a factory.
 &lt;p&gt;
 To permit the discovery of additional chronologies, the {@link java.util.ServiceLoader ServiceLoader}
 is used. A file must be added to the {@code META-INF/services} directory with the
 name 'java.time.chrono.Chronology' listing the implementation classes.
 See the ServiceLoader for more details on service loading.
 For lookup by id or calendarType, the system provided calendars are found
 first followed by application provided calendars.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Each chronology must define a chronology ID that is unique within the system.
 If the chronology represents a calendar system defined by the
 CLDR specification then the calendar type is the concatenation of the
 CLDR type and, if applicable, the CLDR variant,

 @implSpec
 This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.

 This obtains a chronology based on the specified temporal.
 A {@code TemporalAccessor} represents an arbitrary set of date and time information,
 which this factory converts to an instance of {@code Chronology}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The conversion will obtain the chronology using {@link TemporalQueries#chronology()}.
 If the specified temporal object does not have a chronology, {@link java.time.chrono.IsoChronology} is returned.
 &lt;p&gt;

</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This returns a {@code Chronology} based on the specified locale,
 typically returning {@code IsoChronology}. Other calendar systems
 are only returned if they are explicitly selected within the locale.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@link Locale} class provide access to a range of information useful
 for localizing an application. This includes the language and region,
 such as &quot;en-GB&quot; for English as used in Great Britain.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@code Locale} class also supports an extension mechanism that
 can be used to identify a calendar system. The mechanism is a form
 of key-value pairs, where the calendar system has the key &quot;ca&quot;.
 For example, the locale &quot;en-JP-u-ca-japanese&quot; represents the English
 language as used in Japan with the Japanese calendar system.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This method finds the desired calendar system by in a manner equivalent
 to passing &quot;ca&quot; to {@link Locale#getUnicodeLocaleType(String)}.
 If the &quot;ca&quot; key is not present, then {@code IsoChronology} is returned.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Note that the behavior of this method differs from the older
 {@link java.util.Calendar#getInstance(Locale)} method.
 If that method receives a locale of &quot;th_TH&quot; it will return {@code BuddhistCalendar}.
 By contrast, this method will return {@code IsoChronology}.
 Passing the locale &quot;th-TH-u-ca-buddhist&quot; into either method will
 result in the Thai Buddhist calendar system and is therefore the
 recommended approach going forward for Thai calendar system localization.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A similar, but simpler, situation occurs for the Japanese calendar system.
 The locale &quot;jp_JP_JP&quot; has previously been used to access the calendar.
 However, unlike the Thai locale, &quot;ja_JP_JP&quot; is automatically converted by
 {@code Locale} to the modern and recommended form of &quot;ja-JP-u-ca-japanese&quot;.
 Thus, there is no difference in behavior between this method and
 {@code Calendar#getInstance(Locale)}.
