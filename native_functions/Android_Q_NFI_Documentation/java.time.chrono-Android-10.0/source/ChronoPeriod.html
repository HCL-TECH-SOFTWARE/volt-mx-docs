</span> implements java.time.temporal.TemporalAmount

 A date-based amount of time, such as '3 years, 4 months and 5 days' in an
 arbitrary chronology, intended for advanced globalization use cases.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This interface models a date-based amount of time in a calendar system.
 While most calendar systems use years, months and days, some do not.
 Therefore, this interface operates solely in terms of a set of supported
 units that are defined by the {@code Chronology}.
 The set of supported units is fixed for a given chronology.
 The amount of a supported unit may be set to zero.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The period is modeled as a directed amount of time, meaning that individual
 parts of the period may be negative.

 @implSpec
 This interface must be implemented with care to ensure other classes operate correctly.
 All implementations that can be instantiated must be final, immutable and thread-safe.
 Subclasses should be Serializable wherever possible.

 @since 1.8
