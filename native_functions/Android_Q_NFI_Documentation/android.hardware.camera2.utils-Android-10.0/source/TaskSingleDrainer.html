 Keep track of a single concurrent task starting and finishing;
 allow draining the existing task and figuring out when the task has finished
 (and won't restart).

 &lt;p&gt;The initial state is to allow all tasks to be started and finished. A task may only be started
 once, after which it must be finished before starting again. Likewise, finishing a task
 that hasn't been started is also not allowed.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;When draining begins, the task cannot be started again. This guarantees that at some
 point the task will be finished forever, at which point the {@link android.hardware.camera2.utils.TaskDrainer.DrainListener#onDrained}
 callback will be invoked.&lt;/p&gt;
