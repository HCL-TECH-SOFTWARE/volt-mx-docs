 A standard set of fields.

 The standard set of fields can be extended by implementing {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalField}.

 For example, most non-ISO calendar systems define dates as a year, month and day,

 The era 'CE' is the one currently in use and year-of-era runs from 1 to the maximum value.
 The era 'BCE' is the previous era, and the year-of-era runs backwards.

 Note that the ISO-8601 standard does not actually define eras.
 Note also that the ISO eras do not align with the well-known AD/BC eras due to the
 change between the Julian and Gregorian calendar systems.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Non-ISO calendar systems should implement this field using the most recognized

 Since most calendar systems have only two eras, the year-of-era numbering approach

 This field may be used with {@link #NANO_OF_SECOND} to represent the fraction of the second.
 &lt;p&gt;
 An {@link Instant} represents an instantaneous point on the time-line.
 On their own, an instant has insufficient information to allow a local date-time to be obtained.
 Only when paired with an offset or time-zone can the local date or time be calculated.

 This field is strictly defined to have the same meaning in all calendar systems.
 This is necessary to ensure interoperation between calendars.

 This represents the concept of the offset in seconds of local time from UTC/Greenwich.

 A {@link ZoneOffset} represents the period of time that local time differs from UTC/Greenwich.
 This is usually a fixed number of hours and minutes.
 It is equivalent to the {@link ZoneOffset#getTotalSeconds() total amount} of the offset in seconds.
 For example, during the winter Paris has an offset of {@code +01:00}, which is 3600 seconds.
