</span> Framework-level interface defining an amount of time, such as
 &quot;6 hours&quot;, &quot;8 days&quot; or &quot;2 years and 3 months&quot;.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This is the base interface type for amounts of time.
 An amount is distinct from a date or time-of-day in that it is not tied
 to any specific point on the time-line.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The amount can be thought of as a {@code Map} of {@link java.time.temporal.TemporalUnit} to
 {@code long}, exposed via {@link #getUnits}() and {@link #get}(TemporalUnit).
 A simple case might have a single unit-value pair, such as &quot;6 hours&quot;.
 A more complex case may have multiple unit-value pairs, such as
 &quot;7 years, 3 months and 5 days&quot;.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two common implementations.
 {@link Period} is a date-based implementation, storing years, months and days.
 {@link Duration} is a time-based implementation, storing seconds and nanoseconds,
 but providing some access using other duration based units such as minutes,
 hours and fixed 24-hour days.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely
 used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass
 around instances of concrete types, such as {@code Period} and {@code Duration}.

 @implSpec
 This interface places no restrictions on the mutability of implementations,
 however immutability is strongly recommended.

 Adds the amount to the specified temporal object using the logic

 The first is to invoke this method directly.
 The second is to use {@link java.time.temporal.Temporal#plus(java.time.temporal.TemporalAmount)}:

   dateTime = amount.addTo(dateTime);
   dateTime = dateTime.plus(adder);

 It is recommended to use the second approach, {@code plus(TemporalAmount)},
 as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
