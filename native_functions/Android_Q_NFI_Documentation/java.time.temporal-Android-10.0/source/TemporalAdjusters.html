 Common and useful TemporalAdjusters.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Adjusters are a key tool for modifying temporal objects.
 They exist to externalize the process of adjustment, permitting different
 approaches, as per the strategy design pattern.
 Examples might be an adjuster that sets the date avoiding weekends, or one that
 sets the date to the last day of the month.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are two equivalent ways of using a {@code TemporalAdjuster}.
 The first is to invoke the method on the interface directly.
 The second is to use {@link java.time.temporal.Temporal#with(java.time.temporal.TemporalAdjuster)}:
 &lt;pre&gt;
   // these two lines are equivalent, but the second approach is recommended
   temporal = thisAdjuster.adjustInto(temporal);
   temporal = temporal.with(thisAdjuster);
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 It is recommended to use the second approach, {@code with(TemporalAdjuster)},
 as it is a lot clearer to read in code.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This class contains a standard set of adjusters, available as static methods.
 These include:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;finding the first or last day of the month
 &lt;li&gt;finding the first day of next month
 &lt;li&gt;finding the first or last day of the year
 &lt;li&gt;finding the first day of next year
 &lt;li&gt;finding the first or last day-of-week within a month, such as &quot;first Wednesday in June&quot;
 &lt;li&gt;finding the next or previous day-of-week, such as &quot;next Thursday&quot;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 @implSpec
 All the implementations supplied by the static methods are immutable.

 The {@code TemporalAdjuster} is based on the low level {@code Temporal} interface.
 This method allows an adjustment from {@code LocalDate} to {@code LocalDate}
 to be wrapped to match the temporal-based interface.
 This is provided for convenience to make user-written adjusters simpler.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In general, user-written adjusters should be static constants:

 &lt;p&gt;
 For a positive or zero ordinal, the algorithm is equivalent to finding the first
 day-of-week that matches within the month and then adding a number of weeks to it.
 For a negative ordinal, the algorithm is equivalent to finding the last
 day-of-week that matches within the month and then subtracting a number of weeks to it.
 The ordinal number of weeks is not validated and is interpreted leniently
 according to this algorithm. This definition means that an ordinal of zero finds
 the last matching day-of-week in the previous month.
