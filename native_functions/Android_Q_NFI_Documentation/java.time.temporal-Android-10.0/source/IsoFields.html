 Fields and units specific to the ISO-8601 calendar system,
 including quarter-of-year and week-based-year.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This class defines fields and units that are specific to the ISO calendar system.

 &lt;h3&gt;Quarter of year&lt;/h3&gt;
 The ISO-8601 standard is based on the standard civic 12 month year.
 This is commonly divided into four quarters, often abbreviated as Q1, Q2, Q3 and Q4.
 &lt;p&gt;
 January, February and March are in Q1.
 April, May and June are in Q2.
 July, August and September are in Q3.
 October, November and December are in Q4.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The complete date is expressed using three fields:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #DAY_OF_QUARTER DAY_OF_QUARTER} - the day within the quarter, from 1 to 90, 91 or 92
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #QUARTER_OF_YEAR QUARTER_OF_YEAR} - the week within the week-based-year
 &lt;li&gt;{@link java.time.temporal.ChronoField#YEAR YEAR} - the standard ISO year
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;Week based years&lt;/h3&gt;
 The ISO-8601 standard was originally intended as a data interchange format,
 defining a string format for dates and times. However, it also defines an
 alternate way of expressing the date, based on the concept of week-based-year.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The date is expressed using three fields:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;{@link java.time.temporal.ChronoField#DAY_OF_WEEK DAY_OF_WEEK} - the standard field defining the
  day-of-week from Monday (1) to Sunday (7)
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #WEEK_OF_WEEK_BASED_YEAR} - the week within the week-based-year
 &lt;li&gt;{@link #WEEK_BASED_YEAR WEEK_BASED_YEAR} - the week-based-year
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 The week-based-year itself is defined relative to the standard ISO proleptic year.
 It differs from the standard year in that it always starts on a Monday.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The first week of a week-based-year is the first Monday-based week of the standard
 ISO year that has at least 4 days in the new year.
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Monday then week 1 starts on January 1st
 &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Tuesday then week 1 starts on December 31st of the previous standard year
 &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Wednesday then week 1 starts on December 30th of the previous standard year
 &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Thursday then week 1 starts on December 29th of the previous standard year
 &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Friday then week 1 starts on January 4th
 &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Saturday then week 1 starts on January 3rd
 &lt;li&gt;If January 1st is Sunday then week 1 starts on January 2nd
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 There are 52 weeks in most week-based years, however on occasion there are 53 weeks.
 &lt;p&gt;
 For example:

 &lt;table cellpadding=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;3&quot; border=&quot;0&quot; style=&quot;text-align: left; width: 50%;&quot;&gt;
 &lt;caption&gt;Examples of Week based Years&lt;/caption&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;Date&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Day-of-week&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;Field values&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2008-12-28&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sunday&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 52 of week-based-year 2008&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2008-12-29&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Monday&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 1 of week-based-year 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2008-12-31&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Wednesday&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 1 of week-based-year 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2009-01-01&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Thursday&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 1 of week-based-year 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2009-01-04&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Sunday&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 1 of week-based-year 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;2009-01-05&lt;/th&gt;&lt;td&gt;Monday&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Week 2 of week-based-year 2009&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;

var IsoFields = {

<span id='java-time-temporal-IsoFields-property-DAY_OF_QUARTER'>/** The field that represents the day-of-quarter.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This field allows the day-of-quarter value to be queried and set.
 The day-of-quarter has values from 1 to 90 in Q1 of a standard year, from 1 to 91
 in Q1 of a leap year, from 1 to 91 in Q2 and from 1 to 92 in Q3 and Q4.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The day-of-quarter can only be calculated if the day-of-year, month-of-year and year
 are available.
 &lt;p&gt;
 When setting this field, the value is allowed to be partially lenient, taking any
 value from 1 to 92. If the quarter has less than 92 days, then day 92, and
 potentially day 91, is in the following quarter.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a year,
 quarter-of-year and day-of-quarter.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In {@linkplain ResolverStyle#STRICT strict mode}, all three fields are
 validated against their range of valid values. The day-of-quarter field
 is validated from 1 to 90, 91 or 92 depending on the year and quarter.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In {@linkplain ResolverStyle#SMART smart mode}, all three fields are
 validated against their range of valid values. The day-of-quarter field is
 validated between 1 and 92, ignoring the actual range based on the year and quarter.
 If the day-of-quarter exceeds the actual range by one day, then the resulting date
 is one day later. If the day-of-quarter exceeds the actual range by two days,
 then the resulting date is two days later.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In {@linkplain ResolverStyle#LENIENT lenient mode}, only the year is validated
 against the range of valid values. The resulting date is calculated equivalent to
 the following three stage approach. First, create a date on the first of January
 in the requested year. Then take the quarter-of-year, subtract one, and add the
 amount in quarters to the date. Finally, take the day-of-quarter, subtract one,
 and add the amount in days to the date.

 The quarter-of-year has values from 1 to 4.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The quarter-of-year can only be calculated if the month-of-year is available.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a year,
 quarter-of-year and day-of-quarter.

</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This field allows the week of the week-based-year value to be queried and set.
 The week-of-week-based-year has values from 1 to 52, or 53 if the
 week-based-year has 53 weeks.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In the resolving phase of parsing, a date can be created from a
 week-based-year, week-of-week-based-year and day-of-week.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In {@linkplain ResolverStyle#STRICT strict mode}, all three fields are
 validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-week-based-year
 field is validated from 1 to 52 or 53 depending on the week-based-year.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In {@linkplain ResolverStyle#SMART smart mode}, all three fields are
 validated against their range of valid values. The week-of-week-based-year
 field is validated between 1 and 53, ignoring the week-based-year.
 If the week-of-week-based-year is 53, but the week-based-year only has
 52 weeks, then the resulting date is in week 1 of the following week-based-year.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In {@linkplain ResolverStyle#LENIENT lenient mode}, only the week-based-year
 is validated against the range of valid values. If the day-of-week is outside
 the range 1 to 7, then the resulting date is adjusted by a suitable number of
 weeks to reduce the day-of-week to the range 1 to 7. If the week-of-week-based-year
 value is outside the range 1 to 52, then any excess weeks are added or subtracted
 from the resulting date.

 The unit is equal to either 52 or 53 weeks.
 The estimated duration of a week-based-year is the same as that of a standard ISO
 year at {@code 365.2425 Days}.

 The rules for addition add the number of week-based-years to the existing value
