 Dispatcher to send KeyEvents to all accessibility services that are able to process them.
 Events that are handled by one or more services are consumed. Events that are not processed
 by any service (or time out before a service reports them as handled) are passed along to
 the rest of the system.

 The class assumes that services report their return values in order, which is valid because
 they process each call to {@code AccessibilityService.onKeyEvent} on a single thread, and so
 don't see the N+1th event until they have processed the Nth event.
