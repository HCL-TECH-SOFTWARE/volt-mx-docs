 The class Authenticator represents an object that knows how to obtain
 authentication for a network connection.  Usually, it will do this
 by prompting the user for information.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Applications use this class by overriding {@link #getPasswordAuthentication}() in a sub-class. This method will
 typically use the various getXXX() accessor methods to get information
 about the entity requesting authentication. It must then acquire a
 username and password either by interacting with the user or through
 some other non-interactive means. The credentials are then returned
 as a {@link java.net.PasswordAuthentication} return value.
 &lt;p&gt;
 An instance of this concrete sub-class is then registered
 with the system by calling {@link #setDefault}(Authenticator).
 When authentication is required, the system will invoke one of the
 requestPasswordAuthentication() methods which in turn will call the
 getPasswordAuthentication() method of the registered object.
 &lt;p&gt;
 All methods that request authentication have a default implementation
 that fails.
