 datagrams larger than the buffer size are sent or discarded is system

 an input buffer used by the networking implementation. It may need to be
 increased for high-volume connections or decreased to limit the possible
 backlog of incoming data. The value of the socket option is a
 &lt;em&gt;hint&lt;/em&gt; to the implementation to size the buffer and the actual

 &lt;p&gt; For datagram-oriented sockets, the size of the receive buffer may
 limit the size of the datagrams that can be received. Whether datagrams
 larger than the buffer size can be received is system dependent.
 Increasing the socket receive buffer may be important for cases where
 datagrams arrive in bursts faster than they can be processed.

 &lt;p&gt; In the case of stream-oriented sockets and the TCP/IP protocol, the
 size of the socket receive buffer may be used when advertising the size
 of the TCP receive window to the remote peer.

 &lt;p&gt; The value of this socket option is a {@code Boolean} that represents
 whether the option is enabled or disabled. The exact semantics of this
 socket option are socket type and system dependent.

 &lt;p&gt; In the case of stream-oriented sockets, this socket option will
 usually determine whether the socket can be bound to a socket address
 when a previous connection involving that socket address is in the
 &lt;em&gt;TIME_WAIT&lt;/em&gt; state. On implementations where the semantics differ,
 and the socket option is not required to be enabled in order to bind the
 socket when a previous connection is in this state, then the
 implementation may choose to ignore this option.

 &lt;p&gt; For datagram-oriented sockets the socket option is used to allow
 multiple programs bind to the same address. This option should be enabled
 when the socket is to be used for Internet Protocol (IP) multicasting.

 &lt;p&gt; An implementation allows this socket option to be set before the
 socket is bound or connected. Changing the value of this socket option
 after the socket is bound has no effect. The default value of this
 socket option is system dependent.

</span>
 &lt;p&gt; The value of this socket option is an {@code Integer} that controls
 the action taken when unsent data is queued on the socket and a method
 to close the socket is invoked. If the value of the socket option is zero
 or greater, then it represents a timeout value, in seconds, known as the
 &lt;em&gt;linger interval&lt;/em&gt;. The linger interval is the timeout for the
 {@code close} method to block while the operating system attempts to
 transmit the unsent data or it decides that it is unable to transmit the
 data. If the value of the socket option is less than zero then the option
 is disabled. In that case the {@code close} method does not wait until
 unsent data is transmitted; if possible the operating system will transmit
 any unsent data before the connection is closed.

 &lt;p&gt; This socket option is intended for use with sockets that are configured
 in {@link java.nio.channels.SelectableChannel#isBlocking() blocking} mode
 only. The behavior of the {@code close} method when this option is
 enabled on a non-blocking socket is not defined.

 &lt;p&gt; The initial value of this socket option is a negative value, meaning
 that the option is disabled. The option may be enabled, or the linger
 interval changed, at any time. The maximum value of the linger interval
 is system dependent. Setting the linger interval to a value that is
 greater than its maximum value causes the linger interval to be set to
 its maximum value.

 &lt;p&gt; The value of this socket option is an {@code Integer} representing
 the value of the ToS octet in IP packets sent by sockets to an {@link java.net.StandardProtocolFamily#INET IPv4} socket. The interpretation of the ToS
 octet is network specific and is not defined by this class. Further
 information on the ToS octet can be found in &lt;a

 value, or ignore specific values.

 &lt;p&gt; The initial/default value of the TOS field in the ToS octet is
 implementation specific but will typically be {@code 0}. For
 datagram-oriented sockets the option may be configured at any time after
 the socket has been bound. The new value of the octet is used when sending
 subsequent datagrams. It is system dependent whether this option can be
 queried or changed prior to binding the socket.

 datagrams sent by the datagram-oriented socket.
 In the case of an {@link java.net.StandardProtocolFamily#INET IPv4} socket
 the option is the time-to-live (TTL) on multicast datagrams sent by the
 socket. Datagrams with a TTL of zero are not transmitted on the network
 but may be delivered locally. In the case of an {@link java.net.StandardProtocolFamily#INET6 IPv6} socket the option is the
 &lt;em&gt;hop limit&lt;/em&gt; which is number of &lt;em&gt;hops&lt;/em&gt; that the datagram can
 pass through before expiring on the network. For IPv6 sockets it is
 system dependent whether the option also sets the &lt;em&gt;time-to-live&lt;/em&gt;
 on multicast datagrams sent to IPv4 addresses.

 &lt;p&gt; The initial/default value of the time-to-live setting is typically
 {@code 1}. An implementation allows this socket option to be set after
 the socket is bound. Whether the socket option can be queried or changed

 stream-oriented sockets using the TCP/IP protocol. TCP/IP uses an algorithm
 known as &lt;em&gt;The Nagle Algorithm&lt;/em&gt; to coalesce short segments and
 improve network efficiency.

 &lt;p&gt; The default value of this socket option is {@code FALSE}. The
 socket option should only be enabled in cases where it is known that the
 coalescing impacts performance. The socket option may be enabled at any
 time. In other words, the Nagle Algorithm can be disabled. Once the option

 disabled. If it cannot, then invoking the {@code setOption} method to
