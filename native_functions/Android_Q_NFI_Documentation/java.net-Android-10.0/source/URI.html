 Represents a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) reference.

 &lt;p&gt; Aside from some minor deviations noted below, an instance of this
 class represents a URI reference as defined by
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;RFC&amp;nbsp;2396: Uniform
 Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, amended by &lt;a
 href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2732.txt&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;RFC&amp;nbsp;2732: Format for
 Literal IPv6 Addresses in URLs&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The Literal IPv6 address format
 also supports scope_ids. The syntax and usage of scope_ids is described
 &lt;a href=&quot;Inet6Address.html#scoped&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.
 This class provides constructors for creating URI instances from
 their components or by parsing their string forms, methods for accessing the
 various components of an instance, and methods for normalizing, resolving,
 and relativizing URI instances.  Instances of this class are immutable.


 &lt;h3&gt; URI syntax and components &lt;/h3&gt;

 At the highest level a URI reference (hereinafter simply &quot;URI&quot;) in string
 form has the syntax

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 [&lt;i&gt;scheme&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;{@code :}&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;i&gt;scheme-specific-part&lt;/i&gt;[&lt;b&gt;{@code #}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;fragment&lt;/i&gt;]
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 where square brackets [...] delineate optional components and the characters
 &lt;b&gt;{@code :}&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;{@code #}&lt;/b&gt; stand for themselves.

 &lt;p&gt; An &lt;i&gt;absolute&lt;/i&gt; URI specifies a scheme; a URI that is not absolute is
 said to be &lt;i&gt;relative&lt;/i&gt;.  URIs are also classified according to whether
 they are &lt;i&gt;opaque&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;hierarchical&lt;/i&gt;.

 &lt;p&gt; An &lt;i&gt;opaque&lt;/i&gt; URI is an absolute URI whose scheme-specific part does
 not begin with a slash character ({@code '/'}).  Opaque URIs are not
 subject to further parsing.  Some examples of opaque URIs are:

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;table cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 summary=&quot;layout&quot;&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@code mailto:java-net@java.sun.com}&lt;td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@code news:comp.lang.java}&lt;td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@code urn:isbn:096139210x}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; A &lt;i&gt;hierarchical&lt;/i&gt; URI is either an absolute URI whose
 scheme-specific part begins with a slash character, or a relative URI, that
 is, a URI that does not specify a scheme.  Some examples of hierarchical
 URIs are:

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 {@code http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/}&lt;br&gt;
 {@code docs/guide/collections/designfaq.html#28}&lt;br&gt;
 {@code ../../../demo/jfc/SwingSet2/src/SwingSet2.java}&lt;br&gt;
 {@code file:///~/calendar}
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; A hierarchical URI is subject to further parsing according to the syntax

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 [&lt;i&gt;scheme&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;{@code :}&lt;/b&gt;][&lt;b&gt;{@code //}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;authority&lt;/i&gt;][&lt;i&gt;path&lt;/i&gt;][&lt;b&gt;{@code ?}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;query&lt;/i&gt;][&lt;b&gt;{@code #}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;fragment&lt;/i&gt;]
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 where the characters &lt;b&gt;{@code :}&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;{@code /}&lt;/b&gt;,
 &lt;b&gt;{@code ?}&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;{@code #}&lt;/b&gt; stand for themselves.  The
 scheme-specific part of a hierarchical URI consists of the characters
 between the scheme and fragment components.

 &lt;p&gt; The authority component of a hierarchical URI is, if specified, either
 &lt;i&gt;server-based&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;registry-based&lt;/i&gt;.  A server-based authority
 parses according to the familiar syntax

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 [&lt;i&gt;user-info&lt;/i&gt;&lt;b&gt;{@code @}&lt;/b&gt;]&lt;i&gt;host&lt;/i&gt;[&lt;b&gt;{@code :}&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt;port&lt;/i&gt;]
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 where the characters &lt;b&gt;{@code @}&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;{@code :}&lt;/b&gt; stand for
 themselves.  Nearly all URI schemes currently in use are server-based.  An
 authority component that does not parse in this way is considered to be
 registry-based.

 &lt;p&gt; The path component of a hierarchical URI is itself said to be absolute
 if it begins with a slash character ({@code '/'}); otherwise it is
 relative.  The path of a hierarchical URI that is either absolute or
 specifies an authority is always absolute.

 &lt;p&gt; All told, then, a URI instance has the following nine components:

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;table summary=&quot;Describes the components of a URI:scheme,scheme-specific-part,authority,user-info,host,port,path,query,fragment&quot;&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;i&gt;Component&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;th&gt;&lt;i&gt;Type&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/th&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;scheme&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@code String}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;scheme-specific-part&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@code String}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;authority&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@code String}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;user-info&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@code String}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;host&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@code String}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;port&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@code int}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;path&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@code String}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;query&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@code String}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;fragment&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{@code String}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 In a given instance any particular component is either &lt;i&gt;undefined&lt;/i&gt; or
 &lt;i&gt;defined&lt;/i&gt; with a distinct value.  Undefined string components are
 represented by {@code null}, while undefined integer components are
 represented by {@code -1}.  A string component may be defined to have the
 empty string as its value; this is not equivalent to that component being
 undefined.

 &lt;p&gt; Whether a particular component is or is not defined in an instance
 depends upon the type of the URI being represented.  An absolute URI has a
 scheme component.  An opaque URI has a scheme, a scheme-specific part, and
 possibly a fragment, but has no other components.  A hierarchical URI always
 has a path (though it may be empty) and a scheme-specific-part (which at
 least contains the path), and may have any of the other components.  If the
 authority component is present and is server-based then the host component
 will be defined and the user-information and port components may be defined.


 &lt;h4&gt; Operations on URI instances &lt;/h4&gt;

 The key operations supported by this class are those of
 &lt;i&gt;normalization&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;resolution&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;relativization&lt;/i&gt;.

 &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Normalization&lt;/i&gt; is the process of removing unnecessary {@code &quot;.&quot;}
 and {@code &quot;..&quot;} segments from the path component of a hierarchical URI.
 Each {@code &quot;.&quot;} segment is simply removed.  A {@code &quot;..&quot;} segment is
 removed only if it is preceded by a non-{@code &quot;..&quot;} segment.
 Normalization has no effect upon opaque URIs.

 &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Resolution&lt;/i&gt; is the process of resolving one URI against another,
 &lt;i&gt;base&lt;/i&gt; URI.  The resulting URI is constructed from components of both
 URIs in the manner specified by RFC&amp;nbsp;2396, taking components from the
 base URI for those not specified in the original.  For hierarchical URIs,
 the path of the original is resolved against the path of the base and then
 normalized.  The result, for example, of resolving

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 {@code docs/guide/collections/designfaq.html#28}
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
 &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(1)
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 against the base URI {@code http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/} is the result
 URI

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 {@code http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/collections/designfaq.html#28}
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 Resolving the relative URI

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 {@code ../../../demo/jfc/SwingSet2/src/SwingSet2.java}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(2)
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 against this result yields, in turn,

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 {@code http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/demo/jfc/SwingSet2/src/SwingSet2.java}
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 Resolution of both absolute and relative URIs, and of both absolute and
 relative paths in the case of hierarchical URIs, is supported.  Resolving
 the URI {@code file:///~calendar} against any other URI simply yields the
 original URI, since it is absolute.  Resolving the relative URI (2) above
 against the relative base URI (1) yields the normalized, but still relative,
 URI

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 {@code demo/jfc/SwingSet2/src/SwingSet2.java}
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt; &lt;i&gt;Relativization&lt;/i&gt;, finally, is the inverse of resolution: For any
 two normalized URIs &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt; and&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;,

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;{@code .relativize(}&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;{@code .resolve(}&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;{@code )).equals(}&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;{@code )}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;and&lt;br&gt;
   &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;{@code .resolve(}&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;{@code .relativize(}&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;{@code )).equals(}&lt;i&gt;v&lt;/i&gt;{@code )}&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;.&lt;br&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 This operation is often useful when constructing a document containing URIs
 that must be made relative to the base URI of the document wherever
 possible.  For example, relativizing the URI

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 {@code http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/guide/index.html}
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 against the base URI

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 {@code http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3}
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 yields the relative URI {@code docs/guide/index.html}.


 &lt;h4&gt; Character categories &lt;/h4&gt;

 RFC&amp;nbsp;2396 specifies precisely which characters are permitted in the
 various components of a URI reference.  The following categories, most of
 which are taken from that specification, are used below to describe these
 constraints:

 &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;table cellspacing=2 summary=&quot;Describes categories alpha,digit,alphanum,unreserved,punct,reserved,escaped,and other&quot;&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th valign=top&gt;&lt;i&gt;alpha&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;The US-ASCII alphabetic characters,
        {@code 'A'}&amp;nbsp;through&amp;nbsp;{@code 'Z'}
        and {@code 'a'}&amp;nbsp;through&amp;nbsp;{@code 'z'}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th valign=top&gt;&lt;i&gt;digit&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;The US-ASCII decimal digit characters,
       {@code '0'}&amp;nbsp;through&amp;nbsp;{@code '9'}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th valign=top&gt;&lt;i&gt;alphanum&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;All &lt;i&gt;alpha&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;digit&lt;/i&gt; characters&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th valign=top&gt;&lt;i&gt;unreserved&lt;/i&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/th&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;All &lt;i&gt;alphanum&lt;/i&gt; characters together with those in the string
        {@code &quot;_-!.~'()*&quot;}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th valign=top&gt;&lt;i&gt;punct&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;The characters in the string {@code &quot;,;:$&amp;+=&quot;}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th valign=top&gt;&lt;i&gt;reserved&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;All &lt;i&gt;punct&lt;/i&gt; characters together with those in the string
        {@code &quot;?/[]@&quot;}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th valign=top&gt;&lt;i&gt;escaped&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;Escaped octets, that is, triplets consisting of the percent
           character ({@code '%'}) followed by two hexadecimal digits
           ({@code '0'}-{@code '9'}, {@code 'A'}-{@code 'F'}, and
           {@code 'a'}-{@code 'f'})&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
   &lt;tr&gt;&lt;th valign=top&gt;&lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/th&gt;
       &lt;td&gt;The Unicode characters that are not in the US-ASCII character set,
           are not control characters (according to the {@link java.lang.Character#isISOControl(char) Character.isISOControl}
           method), and are not space characters (according to the {@link java.lang.Character#isSpaceChar(char) Character.isSpaceChar}
           method)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;i&gt;(&lt;b&gt;Deviation from RFC 2396&lt;/b&gt;, which is
           limited to US-ASCII)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;legal-chars&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; The set of all legal URI characters consists of
 the &lt;i&gt;unreserved&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;reserved&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;escaped&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt;
 characters.


 &lt;h4&gt; Escaped octets, quotation, encoding, and decoding &lt;/h4&gt;

 RFC 2396 allows escaped octets to appear in the user-info, path, query, and
 fragment components.  Escaping serves two purposes in URIs:

 &lt;ul&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; To &lt;i&gt;encode&lt;/i&gt; non-US-ASCII characters when a URI is required to
   conform strictly to RFC&amp;nbsp;2396 by not containing any &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt;
   characters.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; To &lt;i&gt;quote&lt;/i&gt; characters that are otherwise illegal in a
   component.  The user-info, path, query, and fragment components differ
   slightly in terms of which characters are considered legal and illegal.
   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;/ul&gt;

 These purposes are served in this class by three related operations:

 &lt;ul&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;encode&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; A character is &lt;i&gt;encoded&lt;/i&gt; by replacing it
   with the sequence of escaped octets that represent that character in the
   UTF-8 character set.  The Euro currency symbol ({@code '\u20AC'}),
   for example, is encoded as {@code &quot;%E2%82%AC&quot;}.  &lt;i&gt;(&lt;b&gt;Deviation from
   RFC&amp;nbsp;2396&lt;/b&gt;, which does not specify any particular character
   set.)&lt;/i&gt; &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;quote&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; An illegal character is &lt;i&gt;quoted&lt;/i&gt; simply by
   encoding it.  The space character, for example, is quoted by replacing it
   with {@code &quot;%20&quot;}.  UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence for US-ASCII
   characters this transformation has exactly the effect required by
   RFC&amp;nbsp;2396. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a name=&quot;decode&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
   A sequence of escaped octets is &lt;i&gt;decoded&lt;/i&gt; by
   replacing it with the sequence of characters that it represents in the
   UTF-8 character set.  UTF-8 contains US-ASCII, hence decoding has the
   effect of de-quoting any quoted US-ASCII characters as well as that of
   decoding any encoded non-US-ASCII characters.  If a &lt;a
   href=&quot;../nio/charset/CharsetDecoder.html#ce&quot;&gt;decoding error&lt;/a&gt; occurs
   when decoding the escaped octets then the erroneous octets are replaced by
   {@code '\uFFFD'}, the Unicode replacement character.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;/ul&gt;

 These operations are exposed in the constructors and methods of this class
 as follows:

 &lt;ul&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@linkplain #URI(java.lang.String) single-argument
   constructor} requires any illegal characters in its argument to be
   quoted and preserves any escaped octets and &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; characters that
   are present.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@linkplain
   #URI(java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String,int,java.lang.String,java.lang.String,java.lang.String)
   multi-argument constructors} quote illegal characters as
   required by the components in which they appear.  The percent character
   ({@code '%'}) is always quoted by these constructors.  Any &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt;
   characters are preserved.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #getRawUserInfo() getRawUserInfo}, {@link #getRawPath()
   getRawPath}, {@link #getRawQuery() getRawQuery}, {@link #getRawFragment()
   getRawFragment}, {@link #getRawAuthority() getRawAuthority}, and {@link #getRawSchemeSpecificPart() getRawSchemeSpecificPart} methods return the
   values of their corresponding components in raw form, without interpreting
   any escaped octets.  The strings returned by these methods may contain
   both escaped octets and &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; characters, and will not contain any
   illegal characters.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #getUserInfo() getUserInfo}, {@link #getPath()
   getPath}, {@link #getQuery() getQuery}, {@link #getFragment()
   getFragment}, {@link #getAuthority() getAuthority}, and {@link #getSchemeSpecificPart() getSchemeSpecificPart} methods decode any escaped
   octets in their corresponding components.  The strings returned by these
   methods may contain both &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; characters and illegal characters,
   and will not contain any escaped octets.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #toString() toString} method returns a URI string with
   all necessary quotation but which may contain &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt; characters.
   &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; The {@link #toASCIIString() toASCIIString} method returns a fully
   quoted and encoded URI string that does not contain any &lt;i&gt;other&lt;/i&gt;
   characters.  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;/ul&gt;


 &lt;h4&gt; Identities &lt;/h4&gt;

 For any URI &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;, it is always the case that

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 {@code new URI(}&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;{@code .toString()).equals(}&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;{@code )}&amp;nbsp;.
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 For any URI &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt; that does not contain redundant syntax such as two
 slashes before an empty authority (as in {@code file:///tmp/}&amp;nbsp;) or a
 colon following a host name but no port (as in
 {@code http://java.sun.com:}&amp;nbsp;), and that does not encode characters
 except those that must be quoted, the following identities also hold:
 &lt;pre&gt;
     new URI(&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getScheme(),
             &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getSchemeSpecificPart(),
             &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getFragment())
     .equals(&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/pre&gt;
 in all cases,
 &lt;pre&gt;
     new URI(&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getScheme(),
             &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getUserInfo(), &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getAuthority(),
             &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getPath(), &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getQuery(),
             &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getFragment())
     .equals(&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/pre&gt;
 if &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt; is hierarchical, and
 &lt;pre&gt;
     new URI(&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getScheme(),
             &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getUserInfo(), &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getHost(), &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getPort(),
             &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getPath(), &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getQuery(),
             &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;.getFragment())
     .equals(&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;)&lt;/pre&gt;
 if &lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt; is hierarchical and has either no authority or a server-based
 authority.


 &lt;h4&gt; URIs, URLs, and URNs &lt;/h4&gt;

 A URI is a uniform resource &lt;i&gt;identifier&lt;/i&gt; while a URL is a uniform
 resource &lt;i&gt;locator&lt;/i&gt;.  Hence every URL is a URI, abstractly speaking, but
 not every URI is a URL.  This is because there is another subcategory of
 URIs, uniform resource &lt;i&gt;names&lt;/i&gt; (URNs), which name resources but do not
 specify how to locate them.  The {@code mailto}, {@code news}, and
 {@code isbn} URIs shown above are examples of URNs.

 &lt;p&gt; The conceptual distinction between URIs and URLs is reflected in the
 differences between this class and the {@link java.net.URL} class.

 &lt;p&gt; An instance of this class represents a URI reference in the syntactic
 sense defined by RFC&amp;nbsp;2396.  A URI may be either absolute or relative.
 A URI string is parsed according to the generic syntax without regard to the
 scheme, if any, that it specifies.  No lookup of the host, if any, is
 performed, and no scheme-dependent stream handler is constructed.  Equality,
 hashing, and comparison are defined strictly in terms of the character
 content of the instance.  In other words, a URI instance is little more than
 a structured string that supports the syntactic, scheme-independent
 operations of comparison, normalization, resolution, and relativization.

 &lt;p&gt; An instance of the {@link java.net.URL} class, by contrast, represents the
 syntactic components of a URL together with some of the information required
 to access the resource that it describes.  A URL must be absolute, that is,
 it must always specify a scheme.  A URL string is parsed according to its
 scheme.  A stream handler is always established for a URL, and in fact it is
 impossible to create a URL instance for a scheme for which no handler is
 available.  Equality and hashing depend upon both the scheme and the
 Internet address of the host, if any; comparison is not defined.  In other
 words, a URL is a structured string that supports the syntactic operation of
 resolution as well as the network I/O operations of looking up the host and
 opening a connection to the specified resource.

 &lt;p&gt; If this URI's authority component has already been recognized as
 being server-based then it will already have been parsed into
 user-information, host, and port components.  In this case, or if this
 URI has no authority component, this method simply returns this URI.

 &lt;p&gt; Otherwise this method attempts once more to parse the authority
 component into user-information, host, and port components, and throws
 an exception describing why the authority component could not be parsed
 in that way.

 &lt;p&gt; This method is provided because the generic URI syntax specified in
 &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2396.txt&quot;&gt;RFC&amp;nbsp;2396&lt;/a&gt;
 cannot always distinguish a malformed server-based authority from a
 legitimate registry-based authority.  It must therefore treat some
 instances of the former as instances of the latter.  The authority
 component in the URI string {@code &quot;//foo:bar&quot;}, for example, is not a
 legal server-based authority but it is legal as a registry-based
 authority.

 &lt;p&gt; In many common situations, for example when working URIs that are
 known to be either URNs or URLs, the hierarchical URIs being used will
 always be server-based.  They therefore must either be parsed as such or
 treated as an error.  In these cases a statement such as

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 {@code URI }&lt;i&gt;u&lt;/i&gt;{@code  = new URI(str).parseServerAuthority();}

 &lt;p&gt; When comparing corresponding components of two URIs, if one
 component is undefined but the other is defined then the first is
 considered to be less than the second.  Unless otherwise noted, string
 components are ordered according to their natural, case-sensitive
 ordering as defined by the {@link java.lang.String#compareTo(Object)
 String.compareTo} method.  String components that are subject to
 encoding are compared by comparing their raw forms rather than their
 encoded forms.

 &lt;p&gt; The ordering of URIs is defined as follows: &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;ul&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two URIs with different schemes are ordered according the
   ordering of their schemes, without regard to case. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; A hierarchical URI is considered to be less than an opaque URI
   with an identical scheme. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two opaque URIs with identical schemes are ordered according
   to the ordering of their scheme-specific parts. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two opaque URIs with identical schemes and scheme-specific
   parts are ordered according to the ordering of their
   fragments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Two hierarchical URIs with identical schemes are ordered
   according to the ordering of their authority components: &lt;/p&gt;

   &lt;ul&gt;

     &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; If both authority components are server-based then the URIs
     are ordered according to their user-information components; if these
     components are identical then the URIs are ordered according to the
     ordering of their hosts, without regard to case; if the hosts are
     identical then the URIs are ordered according to the ordering of
     their ports. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

     &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; If one or both authority components are registry-based then
     the URIs are ordered according to the ordering of their authority
     components. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

   &lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt; Finally, two hierarchical URIs with identical schemes and
   authority components are ordered according to the ordering of their
   paths; if their paths are identical then they are ordered according to
   the ordering of their queries; if the queries are identical then they
   are ordered according to the order of their fragments. &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

 &lt;/ul&gt;
