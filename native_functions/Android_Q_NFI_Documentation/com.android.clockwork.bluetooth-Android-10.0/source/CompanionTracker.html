 This class monitors and maintains the mapping to the currently paired Companion device.

 This class expects the PairingHandler in ClockworkHome to set the Companion address
 under Settings.BLUETOOTH_URI when the user initiates a successful pairing to the watch
 from the Companion app.

 For the legacy case of there being a previously-paired device with no Companion address
 written in Settings, CompanionTracker will infer the Companion device and store its address
 into the same Settings location.

 Normally, we should just check the device type of mCompanion. But b/62355127 revealed that
 BluetoothDevice.getType() can return LE/DUAL even for an Android device (particularly
 when bonding is unexpectedly lost and re-established).  To workaround this, we rely on the
 KEY_BLUETOOTH_MODE setting written by ConnectionSetupHelper in Setup, which during the
 initial pairing process correctly identifies the device type.

 BluetoothDevice.getType() is used as a fallback only if for some reason the
 KEY_BLUETOOTH_MODE setting has not been populated.
