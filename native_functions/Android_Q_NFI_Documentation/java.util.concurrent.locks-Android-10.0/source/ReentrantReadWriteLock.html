</span> implements java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock

 implements java.io.Serializable

@extends java.lang.Object

 An implementation of {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock} supporting similar
 semantics to {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock}.
 &lt;p&gt;This class has the following properties:

 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Acquisition order&lt;/b&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This class does not impose a reader or writer preference
 ordering for lock access.  However, it does support an optional
 &lt;em&gt;fairness&lt;/em&gt; policy.

 &lt;dl&gt;
 &lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Non-fair mode (default)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;dd style=&quot;font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;
 When constructed as non-fair (the default), the order of entry
 to the read and write lock is unspecified, subject to reentrancy
 constraints.  A nonfair lock that is continuously contended may
 indefinitely postpone one or more reader or writer threads, but
 will normally have higher throughput than a fair lock.

 &lt;dt&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;Fair mode&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;dd style=&quot;font-family:'DejaVu Sans', Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;
 When constructed as fair, threads contend for entry using an
 approximately arrival-order policy. When the currently held lock
 is released, either the longest-waiting single writer thread will
 be assigned the write lock, or if there is a group of reader threads
 waiting longer than all waiting writer threads, that group will be
 assigned the read lock.

 &lt;p&gt;A thread that tries to acquire a fair read lock (non-reentrantly)
 will block if either the write lock is held, or there is a waiting
 writer thread. The thread will not acquire the read lock until
 after the oldest currently waiting writer thread has acquired and
 released the write lock. Of course, if a waiting writer abandons
 its wait, leaving one or more reader threads as the longest waiters
 in the queue with the write lock free, then those readers will be
 assigned the read lock.

 &lt;p&gt;A thread that tries to acquire a fair write lock (non-reentrantly)
 will block unless both the read lock and write lock are free (which
 implies there are no waiting threads).  (Note that the non-blocking
 {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.ReadLock#tryLock()} and {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.WriteLock#tryLock()} methods
 do not honor this fair setting and will immediately acquire the lock
 if it is possible, regardless of waiting threads.)
 &lt;/dl&gt;

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reentrancy&lt;/b&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This lock allows both readers and writers to reacquire read or
 write locks in the style of a {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock}. Non-reentrant
 readers are not allowed until all write locks held by the writing
 thread have been released.

 &lt;p&gt;Additionally, a writer can acquire the read lock, but not
 vice-versa.  Among other applications, reentrancy can be useful
 when write locks are held during calls or callbacks to methods that
 perform reads under read locks.  If a reader tries to acquire the
 write lock it will never succeed.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lock downgrading&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;Reentrancy also allows downgrading from the write lock to a read lock,
 by acquiring the write lock, then the read lock and then releasing the
 write lock. However, upgrading from a read lock to the write lock is
 &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; possible.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Interruption of lock acquisition&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The read lock and write lock both support interruption during lock
 acquisition.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;{@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition} support&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;The write lock provides a {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition} implementation that
 behaves in the same way, with respect to the write lock, as the
 {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition} implementation provided by
 {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock#newCondition} does for {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock}.
 This {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition} can, of course, only be used with the write lock.

 &lt;p&gt;The read lock does not support a {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition} and
 {@code readLock().newCondition()} throws
 {@code UnsupportedOperationException}.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Instrumentation&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;This class supports methods to determine whether locks
 are held or contended. These methods are designed for monitoring
 system state, not for synchronization control.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in
 locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of
 its state when serialized.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample usages&lt;/b&gt;. Here is a code sketch showing how to perform
 lock downgrading after updating a cache (exception handling is
 particularly tricky when handling multiple locks in a non-nested
 fashion):

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class CachedData {
   Object data;
   volatile boolean cacheValid;
   final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();

   void processCachedData() {
     rwl.readLock().lock();
     if (!cacheValid) {
       // Must release read lock before acquiring write lock
       rwl.readLock().unlock();
       rwl.writeLock().lock();
       try {
         // Recheck state because another thread might have
         // acquired write lock and changed state before we did.
         if (!cacheValid) {
           data = ...
           cacheValid = true;
         }
         // Downgrade by acquiring read lock before releasing write lock
         rwl.readLock().lock();
       } finally {
         rwl.writeLock().unlock(); // Unlock write, still hold read
       }
     }

     try {
       use(data);
     } finally {
       rwl.readLock().unlock();
     }
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 ReentrantReadWriteLocks can be used to improve concurrency in some
 uses of some kinds of Collections. This is typically worthwhile
 only when the collections are expected to be large, accessed by
 more reader threads than writer threads, and entail operations with
 overhead that outweighs synchronization overhead. For example, here
 is a class using a TreeMap that is expected to be large and
 concurrently accessed.

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class RWDictionary {
   private final Map&lt;String, Data&gt; m = new TreeMap&lt;&gt;();
   private final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock();
   private final Lock r = rwl.readLock();
   private final Lock w = rwl.writeLock();

   public Data get(String key) {
     r.lock();
     try { return m.get(key); }
     finally { r.unlock(); }
   }
   public List&lt;String&gt; allKeys() {
     r.lock();
     try { return new ArrayList&lt;&gt;(m.keySet()); }
     finally { r.unlock(); }
   }
   public Data put(String key, Data value) {
     w.lock();
     try { return m.put(key, value); }
     finally { w.unlock(); }
   }
   public void clear() {
     w.lock();
     try { m.clear(); }
     finally { w.unlock(); }
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;h3&gt;Implementation Notes&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This lock supports a maximum of 65535 recursive write locks
 and 65535 read locks. Attempts to exceed these limits result in
 {@link Error} throws from locking methods.
