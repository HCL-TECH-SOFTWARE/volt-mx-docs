</span> implements java.io.Serializable

@extends java.lang.Object

 A capability-based lock with three modes for controlling read/write
 access.  The state of a StampedLock consists of a version and mode.
 Lock acquisition methods return a stamp that represents and
 controls access with respect to a lock state; &quot;try&quot; versions of
 these methods may instead return the special value zero to
 represent failure to acquire access. Lock release and conversion
 methods require stamps as arguments, and fail if they do not match
 the state of the lock. The three modes are:

 &lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Writing.&lt;/b&gt; Method {@link #writeLock} possibly blocks
   waiting for exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be used
   in method {@link #unlockWrite} to release the lock. Untimed and
   timed versions of {@code tryWriteLock} are also provided. When
   the lock is held in write mode, no read locks may be obtained,
   and all optimistic read validations will fail.

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reading.&lt;/b&gt; Method {@link #readLock} possibly blocks
   waiting for non-exclusive access, returning a stamp that can be
   used in method {@link #unlockRead} to release the lock. Untimed
   and timed versions of {@code tryReadLock} are also provided.

  &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Optimistic Reading.&lt;/b&gt; Method {@link #tryOptimisticRead}
   returns a non-zero stamp only if the lock is not currently held
   in write mode. Method {@link #validate} returns true if the lock
   has not been acquired in write mode since obtaining a given
   stamp.  This mode can be thought of as an extremely weak version
   of a read-lock, that can be broken by a writer at any time.  The
   use of optimistic mode for short read-only code segments often
   reduces contention and improves throughput.  However, its use is
   inherently fragile.  Optimistic read sections should only read
   fields and hold them in local variables for later use after
   validation. Fields read while in optimistic mode may be wildly
   inconsistent, so usage applies only when you are familiar enough
   with data representations to check consistency and/or repeatedly
   invoke method {@code validate()}.  For example, such steps are
   typically required when first reading an object or array
   reference, and then accessing one of its fields, elements or
   methods.

 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This class also supports methods that conditionally provide
 conversions across the three modes. For example, method {@link #tryConvertToWriteLock} attempts to &quot;upgrade&quot; a mode, returning
 a valid write stamp if (1) already in writing mode (2) in reading
 mode and there are no other readers or (3) in optimistic mode and
 the lock is available. The forms of these methods are designed to
 help reduce some of the code bloat that otherwise occurs in
 retry-based designs.

 &lt;p&gt;StampedLocks are designed for use as internal utilities in the
 development of thread-safe components. Their use relies on
 knowledge of the internal properties of the data, objects, and
 methods they are protecting.  They are not reentrant, so locked
 bodies should not call other unknown methods that may try to
 re-acquire locks (although you may pass a stamp to other methods
 that can use or convert it).  The use of read lock modes relies on
 the associated code sections being side-effect-free.  Unvalidated
 optimistic read sections cannot call methods that are not known to
 tolerate potential inconsistencies.  Stamps use finite
 representations, and are not cryptographically secure (i.e., a
 valid stamp may be guessable). Stamp values may recycle after (no
 sooner than) one year of continuous operation. A stamp held without
 use or validation for longer than this period may fail to validate
 correctly.  StampedLocks are serializable, but always deserialize
 into initial unlocked state, so they are not useful for remote
 locking.

 &lt;p&gt;The scheduling policy of StampedLock does not consistently
 prefer readers over writers or vice versa.  All &quot;try&quot; methods are
 best-effort and do not necessarily conform to any scheduling or
 fairness policy. A zero return from any &quot;try&quot; method for acquiring
 or converting locks does not carry any information about the state
 of the lock; a subsequent invocation may succeed.

 &lt;p&gt;Because it supports coordinated usage across multiple lock
 modes, this class does not directly implement the {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock} or
 {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock} interfaces. However, a StampedLock may be
 viewed {@link #asReadLock}(), {@link #asWriteLock}(), or {@link #asReadWriteLock}() in applications requiring only the associated
 set of functionality.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sample Usage.&lt;/b&gt; The following illustrates some usage idioms
 in a class that maintains simple two-dimensional points. The sample
 code illustrates some try/catch conventions even though they are
 not strictly needed here because no exceptions can occur in their
 bodies.&lt;br&gt;

 &lt;pre&gt; {@code
 class Point {
   private double x, y;
   private final StampedLock sl = new StampedLock();

   void move(double deltaX, double deltaY) { // an exclusively locked method
     long stamp = sl.writeLock();
     try {
       x += deltaX;
       y += deltaY;
     } finally {
       sl.unlockWrite(stamp);
     }
   }

   double distanceFromOrigin() { // A read-only method
     long stamp = sl.tryOptimisticRead();
     double currentX = x, currentY = y;
     if (!sl.validate(stamp)) {
        stamp = sl.readLock();
        try {
          currentX = x;
          currentY = y;
        } finally {
           sl.unlockRead(stamp);
        }
     }
     return Math.sqrt(currentX * currentX + currentY * currentY);
   }

   void moveIfAtOrigin(double newX, double newY) { // upgrade
     // Could instead start with optimistic, not read mode
     long stamp = sl.readLock();
     try {
       while (x == 0.0 &amp;&amp; y == 0.0) {
         long ws = sl.tryConvertToWriteLock(stamp);
         if (ws != 0L) {
           stamp = ws;
           x = newX;
           y = newY;
           break;
         }
         else {
           sl.unlockRead(stamp);
           stamp = sl.writeLock();
         }
       }
     } finally {
       sl.unlock(stamp);
     }
   }
 }}&lt;/pre&gt;
