</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 This class provides access to a centralized registry of the user's
 online accounts.  The user enters credentials (username and password) once
 per account, granting applications access to online resources with
 &quot;one-click&quot; approval.

 &lt;p&gt;Different online services have different ways of handling accounts and
 authentication, so the account manager uses pluggable &lt;em&gt;authenticator&lt;/em&gt;
 modules for different &lt;em&gt;account types&lt;/em&gt;.  Authenticators (which may be
 written by third parties) handle the actual details of validating account
 credentials and storing account information.  For example, Google, Facebook,
 and Microsoft Exchange each have their own authenticator.

 &lt;p&gt;Many servers support some notion of an &lt;em&gt;authentication token&lt;/em&gt;,
 which can be used to authenticate a request to the server without sending
 the user's actual password.  (Auth tokens are normally created with a
 separate request which does include the user's credentials.)  AccountManager
 can generate auth tokens for applications, so the application doesn't need to
 handle passwords directly.  Auth tokens are normally reusable and cached by
 AccountManager, but must be refreshed periodically.  It's the responsibility
 of applications to &lt;em&gt;invalidate&lt;/em&gt; auth tokens when they stop working so
 the AccountManager knows it needs to regenerate them.

 &lt;p&gt;Applications accessing a server normally go through these steps:

 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Get an instance of AccountManager using {@link #get}(Context).

 &lt;li&gt;List the available accounts using {@link #getAccountsByType} or
 {@link #getAccountsByTypeAndFeatures}.  Normally applications will only
 be interested in accounts with one particular &lt;em&gt;type&lt;/em&gt;, which
 identifies the authenticator.  Account &lt;em&gt;features&lt;/em&gt; are used to
 identify particular account subtypes and capabilities.  Both the account
 type and features are authenticator-specific strings, and must be known by
 the application in coordination with its preferred authenticators.

 &lt;li&gt;Select one or more of the available accounts, possibly by asking the
 user for their preference.  If no suitable accounts are available,
 {@link #addAccount} may be called to prompt the user to create an
 account of the appropriate type.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; If the application is using a previously remembered
 account selection, it must make sure the account is still in the list
 of accounts returned by {@link #getAccountsByType}.  Requesting an auth token
 for an account no longer on the device results in an undefined failure.

 &lt;li&gt;Request an auth token for the selected account(s) using one of the
 {@link #getAuthToken} methods or related helpers.  Refer to the description
 of each method for exact usage and error handling details.

 &lt;li&gt;Make the request using the auth token.  The form of the auth token,
 the format of the request, and the protocol used are all specific to the
 service you are accessing.  The application may use whatever network and
 protocol libraries are useful.

 &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Important:&lt;/b&gt; If the request fails with an authentication error,
 it could be that a cached auth token is stale and no longer honored by
 the server.  The application must call {@link #invalidateAuthToken} to remove
 the token from the cache, otherwise requests will continue failing!  After
 invalidating the auth token, immediately go back to the &quot;Request an auth
 token&quot; step above.  If the process fails the second time, then it can be
 treated as a &quot;genuine&quot; authentication failure and the user notified or other
 appropriate actions taken.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Some AccountManager methods may need to interact with the user to
 prompt for credentials, present options, or ask the user to add an account.
 The caller may choose whether to allow AccountManager to directly launch the
 necessary user interface and wait for the user, or to return an Intent which
 the caller may use to launch the interface, or (in some cases) to install a
 notification which the user can select at any time to launch the interface.
 To have AccountManager launch the interface directly, the caller must supply
 the current foreground {@link Activity} context.

 &lt;p&gt;Many AccountManager methods take {@link android.accounts.AccountManagerCallback} and
 {@link Handler} as parameters.  These methods return immediately and
 run asynchronously. If a callback is provided then
 {@link android.accounts.AccountManagerCallback#run} will be invoked on the Handler's
 thread when the request completes, successfully or not.
 The result is retrieved by calling {@link android.accounts.AccountManagerFuture#getResult()}
 on the {@link android.accounts.AccountManagerFuture} returned by the method (and also passed
 to the callback).  This method waits for the operation to complete (if
 necessary) and either returns the result or throws an exception if an error
 occurred during the operation.  To make the request synchronously, call
 {@link android.accounts.AccountManagerFuture#getResult()} immediately on receiving the
 future from the method; no callback need be supplied.

 &lt;p&gt;Requests which may block, including
 {@link android.accounts.AccountManagerFuture#getResult()}, must never be called on
 the application's main event thread.  These operations throw
 {@link IllegalStateException} if they are used on the main thread.
