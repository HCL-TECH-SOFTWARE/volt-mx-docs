 and when the capture is complete. In case on an error capturing an image,
 the error method is triggered instead of the completion method.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For a regular capture request, this callback is invoked right as
 the capture of a frame begins, so it is the most appropriate time
 for playing a shutter sound, or triggering UI indicators of capture.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The request that is being used for this capture is provided, along
 with the actual timestamp for the start of exposure. For a reprocess
 request, this timestamp will be the input image's start of exposure
 which matches {@link android.hardware.camera2.CaptureResult#SENSOR_TIMESTAMP the result timestamp field}
 of the {@link android.hardware.camera2.TotalCaptureResult} that was used to
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice#createReprocessCaptureRequest create the reprocess request}.
 This timestamp matches the timestamps that will be
 included in {@link android.hardware.camera2.CaptureResult#SENSOR_TIMESTAMP the result timestamp field},
 and in the buffers sent to each output Surface. These buffer
 timestamps are accessible through, for example,
 {@link android.media.Image#getTimestamp() Image.getTimestamp()} or
 {@link android.graphics.SurfaceTexture#getTimestamp()}.
 The frame number included is equal to the frame number that will be included in
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CaptureResult#getFrameNumber}.&lt;/p&gt;
