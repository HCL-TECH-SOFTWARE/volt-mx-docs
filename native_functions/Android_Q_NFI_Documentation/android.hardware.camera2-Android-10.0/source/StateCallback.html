 &lt;p&gt;Pending capture requests exist in one of two queues: the in-flight queue where requests
 are already in different stages of processing pipeline, and an input queue where requests
 wait to enter the in-flight queue. The input queue is needed because more requests may be
 submitted than the current camera device pipeline depth.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This callback is fired when the input queue becomes empty, and the camera device may
 have to fall back to the repeating request if set, or completely skip the next frame from
 the sensor. This can cause glitches to camera preview output, for example. This callback
 will only fire after requests queued by capture() or captureBurst(), not after a
 repeating request or burst enters the in-flight queue. For example, in the common case
 of a repeating request and a single-shot JPEG capture, this callback only fires when the
 JPEG request has entered the in-flight queue for capture.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;By only sending a new {@link #capture} or {@link #captureBurst} when the input
 queue is empty, pipeline latency can be minimized.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This callback is not fired when the session is first created. It is different from
 {@link #onReady}, which is fired when all requests in both queues have been processed.&lt;/p&gt;

 or when the parent camera device is closed (either by the user closing the device,
 or due to a camera device disconnection or fatal error).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Once a session is closed, all methods on it will throw an IllegalStateException, and

 a capture request.&lt;/p&gt;
