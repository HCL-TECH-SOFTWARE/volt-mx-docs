</span>@extends android.hardware.camera2.CaptureResult

 &lt;p&gt;The total assembled results of a single image capture from the image sensor.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Contains the final configuration for the capture hardware (sensor, lens,
 flash), the processing pipeline, the control algorithms, and the output
 buffers.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;A {@code TotalCaptureResult} is produced by a {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice} after processing a
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CaptureRequest}. All properties listed for capture requests can also
 be queried on the capture result, to determine the final values used for
 capture. The result also includes additional metadata about the state of the
 camera device during the capture.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;All properties returned by {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCharacteristics#getAvailableCaptureResultKeys()}
 are available (that is {@link android.hardware.camera2.CaptureResult#get} will return non-{@code null}, if and only if
 that key that was enabled by the request. A few keys such as
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CaptureResult#STATISTICS_FACES} are disabled by default unless enabled with a switch (such
 as {@link android.hardware.camera2.CaptureRequest#STATISTICS_FACE_DETECT_MODE}). Refer to each key documentation on
 a case-by-case basis.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For a logical multi-camera device, if the CaptureRequest contains a surface for an underlying
 physical camera, the corresponding {@link android.hardware.camera2.TotalCaptureResult} object will include the metadata
 for that physical camera. And the mapping between the physical camera id and result metadata
 can be accessed via {@link #getPhysicalCameraResults}. If all requested surfaces are for the
 logical camera, no metadata for physical camera will be included.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;{@link android.hardware.camera2.TotalCaptureResult} objects are immutable.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The list is returned is unmodifiable; attempting to modify it will result in a
 {@code UnsupportedOperationException} being thrown.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The list size will be inclusive between {@code 0} and

 of when {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCaptureSession.CaptureCallback#onCaptureProgressed} was invoked.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This function can be called for logical multi-camera devices, which are devices that have
 REQUEST_AVAILABLE_CAPABILITIES_LOGICAL_MULTI_CAMERA capability and calls to {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraCharacteristics#getPhysicalCameraIds} return a non-empty set of physical devices that
 are backing the logical camera.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If one or more streams from the underlying physical cameras were requested by the
 corresponding capture request, this function returns the result metadata for those physical
 cameras. Otherwise, an empty map is returned.&lt;/p&gt;
