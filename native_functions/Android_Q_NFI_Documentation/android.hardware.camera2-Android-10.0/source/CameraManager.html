 is disconnected between the calls to {@link #getCameraIdList} and
 {@link #openCamera}, or if a higher-priority camera API client begins using the
 camera device.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;As of API level 23, devices for which the
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraManager.AvailabilityCallback#onCameraUnavailable(String)} callback has been called due to the
 device being in use by a lower-priority, background camera API client can still potentially
 be opened by calling this method when the calling camera API client has a higher priority
 than the current camera API client using this device.  In general, if the top, foreground
 activity is running within your application process, your process will be given the highest
 priority when accessing the camera, and this method will succeed even if the camera device is
 in use by another camera API client. Any lower-priority application that loses control of the
 camera in this way will receive an
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice.StateCallback#onDisconnected} callback.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Once the camera is successfully opened, {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice.StateCallback#onOpened} will
 be invoked with the newly opened {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice}. The camera device can then be set up
 for operation by calling {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice#createCaptureSession} and
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice#createCaptureRequest}&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;!--
 &lt;p&gt;Since the camera device will be opened asynchronously, any asynchronous operations done
 on the returned CameraDevice instance will be queued up until the device startup has
 completed and the callback's {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice.StateCallback#onOpened onOpened} method is
 called. The pending operations are then processed in order.&lt;/p&gt;

 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice.StateCallback#onDisconnected} with a
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice} in the disconnected state (and
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraDevice.StateCallback#onOpened} will be skipped).&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If opening the camera device fails, then the device callback's

 calls on the camera device will throw a {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraAccessException}.&lt;/p&gt;
