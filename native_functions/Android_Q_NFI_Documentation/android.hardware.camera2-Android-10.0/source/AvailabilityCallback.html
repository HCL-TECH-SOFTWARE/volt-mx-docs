 A callback for camera devices becoming available or unavailable to open.

 &lt;p&gt;Cameras become available when they are no longer in use, or when a new
 removable camera is connected. They become unavailable when some
 application or service starts using a camera, or when a removable camera
 is disconnected.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Extend this callback and pass an instance of the subclass to
 {@link android.hardware.camera2.CameraManager#registerAvailabilityCallback} to be notified of such availability
 changes.&lt;/p&gt;

</span>
 &lt;p&gt;Notification that camera access priorities have changed and the camera may
 now be openable. An application that was previously denied camera access due to
 a higher-priority user already using the camera, or that was disconnected from an
 active camera session due to a higher-priority user trying to open the camera,
 should try to open the camera again if it still wants to use it.  Note that
 multiple applications may receive this callback at the same time, and only one of
 them will succeed in opening the camera in practice, depending on exact access
 priority levels and timing. This method is useful in cases where multiple
 applications may be in the resumed state at the same time, and the user switches
 focus between them, or if the current camera-using application moves between
 full-screen and Picture-in-Picture (PiP) states. In such cases, the camera
 available/unavailable callbacks will not be invoked, but another application may
 now have higher priority for camera access than the current camera-using
 application.&lt;/p&gt;
