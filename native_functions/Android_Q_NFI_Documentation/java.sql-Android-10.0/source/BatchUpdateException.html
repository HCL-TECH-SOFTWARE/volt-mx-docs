</span>@extends java.sql.SQLException

 The subclass of {@link java.sql.SQLException} thrown when an error
 occurs during a batch update operation.  In addition to the
 information provided by {@link java.sql.SQLException}, a
 &lt;code&gt;BatchUpdateException&lt;/code&gt; provides the update
 counts for all commands that were executed successfully during the
 batch update, that is, all commands that were executed before the error
 occurred.  The order of elements in an array of update counts
 corresponds to the order in which commands were added to the batch.
 &lt;P&gt;
 After a command in a batch update fails to execute properly
 and a &lt;code&gt;BatchUpdateException&lt;/code&gt; is thrown, the driver
 may or may not continue to process the remaining commands in
 the batch.  If the driver continues processing after a failure,
 the array returned by the method
 &lt;code&gt;BatchUpdateException.getUpdateCounts&lt;/code&gt; will have
 an element for every command in the batch rather than only
 elements for the commands that executed successfully before
 the error.  In the case where the driver continues processing
 commands, the array element for any command
 that failed is &lt;code&gt;Statement.EXECUTE_FAILED&lt;/code&gt;.

<span id='java-sql-BatchUpdateException-method-getUpdateCounts'>/**Retrieves the update count for each update statement in the batch
</span> update that executed successfully before this exception occurred.
 A driver that implements batch updates may or may not continue to
 process the remaining commands in a batch when one of the commands
 fails to execute properly. If the driver continues processing commands,
 the array returned by this method will have as many elements as
 there are commands in the batch; otherwise, it will contain an
 update count for each command that executed successfully before
 the &lt;code&gt;BatchUpdateException&lt;/code&gt; was thrown.
&lt;P&gt;
 The possible return values for this method were modified for
 the Java 2 SDK, Standard Edition, version 1.3.  This was done to
 accommodate the new option of continuing to process commands
 in a batch update after a &lt;code&gt;BatchUpdateException&lt;/code&gt; object
 has been thrown.
@return {Number} an array of &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; containing the update counts
 for the updates that were executed successfully before this error
 occurred.  Or, if the driver continues to process commands after an
 error, one of the following for every command in the batch:
 &lt;OL&gt;
 &lt;LI&gt;an update count
  &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;Statement.SUCCESS_NO_INFO&lt;/code&gt; to indicate that the command
     executed successfully but the number of rows affected is unknown
  &lt;LI&gt;&lt;code&gt;Statement.EXECUTE_FAILED&lt;/code&gt; to indicate that the command
     failed to execute successfully
