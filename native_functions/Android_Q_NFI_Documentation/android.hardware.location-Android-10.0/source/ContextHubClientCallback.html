 A class for {@link android.hardware.location.ContextHubClient ContextHubClient} to
 receive messages and life-cycle events from nanoapps in the Context Hub at which the client is
 attached to.

 This callback is registered through the {@link android.hardware.location.ContextHubManager#createClient(
 ContextHubInfo, ContextHubClientCallback, Executor) creation} of
 {@link android.hardware.location.ContextHubClient ContextHubClient}. Callbacks are invoked in
 the following ways:
 1) Messages from nanoapps delivered through onMessageFromNanoApp may either be broadcasted
    or targeted to a specific client.
 2) Nanoapp or Context Hub events (the remaining callbacks) are broadcasted to all clients, and
    the client can choose to ignore the event by filtering through the parameters.
