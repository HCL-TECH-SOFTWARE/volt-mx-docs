</span>@extends android.app.Service

 A service that receives calls from the system when new notifications are
 posted or removed, or their ranking changed.
 &lt;p&gt;To extend this class, you must declare the service in your manifest file with
 the {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE} permission
 and include an intent filter with the {@link #SERVICE_INTERFACE} action. For example:&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;pre&gt;
 &amp;lt;service android:name=&quot;.NotificationListener&quot;
          android:label=&quot;&amp;#64;string/service_name&quot;
          android:permission=&quot;android.permission.BIND_NOTIFICATION_LISTENER_SERVICE&quot;&gt;
     &amp;lt;intent-filter&gt;
         &amp;lt;action android:name=&quot;android.service.notification.NotificationListenerService&quot; /&gt;
     &amp;lt;/intent-filter&gt;
 &amp;lt;/service&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The service should wait for the {@link #onListenerConnected}() event
 before performing any operations. The {@link #requestRebind}(ComponentName)
 method is the &lt;i&gt;only&lt;/i&gt; one that is safe to call before {@link #onListenerConnected}()
 or after {@link #onListenerDisconnected}().
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt; Notification listeners cannot get notification access or be bound by the system on
 {@linkplain ActivityManager#isLowRamDevice() low-RAM} devices. The system also ignores
 notification listeners running in a work profile. A
 {@link android.app.admin.DevicePolicyManager} might block notifications originating from a work
 profile.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
     From {@link Build.VERSION_CODES#N} onward all callbacks are called on the main thread. Prior
     to N, there is no guarantee on what thread the callback will happen.
 &lt;/p&gt;
