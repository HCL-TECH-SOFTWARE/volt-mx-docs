</span>@extends android.service.notification.NotificationListenerService

 A service that helps the user manage notifications.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Only one notification assistant can be active at a time. Unlike notification listener services,
 assistant services can additionally modify certain aspects about notifications
 (see {@link android.service.notification.Adjustment}) before they are posted.
&lt;p&gt;
 A note about managed profiles: Unlike {@link android.service.notification.NotificationListenerService listener services},
 NotificationAssistantServices are allowed to run in managed profiles
 (see {@link DevicePolicyManager#isManagedProfile(ComponentName)}), so they can access the
 information they need to create good {@link android.service.notification.Adjustment adjustments}. To maintain the contract
 with {@link android.service.notification.NotificationListenerService}, an assistant service will receive all of the
 callbacks from {@link android.service.notification.NotificationListenerService} for the current user, managed profiles of
 that user, and ones that affect all users. However,
 {@link #onNotificationEnqueued}(StatusBarNotification) will only be called for notifications
 sent to the current user, and {@link android.service.notification.Adjustment adjuments} will only be accepted for the
 current user.
 &lt;p&gt;
     All callbacks are called on the main thread.
 &lt;/p&gt;
