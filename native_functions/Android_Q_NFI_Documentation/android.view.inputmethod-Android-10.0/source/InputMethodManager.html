 Central system API to the overall input method framework (IMF) architecture,
 which arbitrates interaction between applications and the current input method.

 &lt;h3&gt;Architecture Overview&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There are three primary parties involved in the input method
 framework (IMF) architecture:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; The &lt;strong&gt;input method manager&lt;/strong&gt; as expressed by this class
 is the central point of the system that manages interaction between all
 other parts.  It is expressed as the client-side API here which exists
 in each application context and communicates with a global system service
 that manages the interaction across all processes.
 &lt;li&gt; An &lt;strong&gt;input method (IME)&lt;/strong&gt; implements a particular
 interaction model allowing the user to generate text.  The system binds
 to the current input method that is in use, causing it to be created and run,
 and tells it when to hide and show its UI.  Only one IME is running at a time.
 &lt;li&gt; Multiple &lt;strong&gt;client applications&lt;/strong&gt; arbitrate with the input
 method manager for input focus and control over the state of the IME.  Only
 one such client is ever active (working with the IME) at a time.
 &lt;/ul&gt;


 &lt;a name=&quot;Applications&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Applications&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In most cases, applications that are using the standard
 {@link android.widget.TextView} or its subclasses will have little they need
 to do to work well with soft input methods.  The main things you need to
 be aware of are:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; Properly set the {@link android.R.attr#inputType} in your editable
 text views, so that the input method will have enough context to help the
 user in entering text into them.
 &lt;li&gt; Deal well with losing screen space when the input method is
 displayed.  Ideally an application should handle its window being resized
 smaller, but it can rely on the system performing panning of the window
 if needed.  You should set the {@link android.R.attr#windowSoftInputMode}
 attribute on your activity or the corresponding values on windows you
 create to help the system determine whether to pan or resize (it will
 try to determine this automatically but may get it wrong).
 &lt;li&gt; You can also control the preferred soft input state (open, closed, etc)
 for your window using the same {@link android.R.attr#windowSoftInputMode}
 attribute.
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;More finer-grained control is available through the APIs here to directly
 interact with the IMF and its IME -- either showing or hiding the input
 area, letting the user pick an input method, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For the rare people amongst us writing their own text editors, you
 will need to implement {@link android.view.View#onCreateInputConnection}
 to return a new instance of your own {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputConnection} interface
 allowing the IME to interact with your editor.&lt;/p&gt;


 &lt;a name=&quot;InputMethods&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Input Methods&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;An input method (IME) is implemented
 as a {@link android.app.Service}, typically deriving from
 {@link android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService}.  It must provide
 the core {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputMethod} interface, though this is normally handled by
 {@link android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService} and implementors will
 only need to deal with the higher-level API there.&lt;/p&gt;

 See the {@link android.inputmethodservice.InputMethodService} class for
 more information on implementing IMEs.


 &lt;a name=&quot;Security&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Security&lt;/h3&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;There are a lot of security issues associated with input methods,
 since they essentially have freedom to completely drive the UI and monitor
 everything the user enters.  The Android input method framework also allows
 arbitrary third party IMEs, so care must be taken to restrict their
 selection and interactions.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Here are some key points about the security architecture behind the
 IMF:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Only the system is allowed to directly access an IME's
 {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputMethod} interface, via the
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_INPUT_METHOD} permission.  This is
 enforced in the system by not binding to an input method service that does
 not require this permission, so the system can guarantee no other untrusted
 clients are accessing the current input method outside of its control.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;There may be many client processes of the IMF, but only one may
 be active at a time.  The inactive clients can not interact with key
 parts of the IMF through the mechanisms described below.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Clients of an input method are only given access to its
 {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodSession} interface.  One instance of this interface is
 created for each client, and only calls from the session associated with
 the active client will be processed by the current IME.  This is enforced
 by {@link android.inputmethodservice.AbstractInputMethodService} for normal
 IMEs, but must be explicitly handled by an IME that is customizing the
 raw {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodSession} implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Only the active client's {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputConnection} will accept
 operations.  The IMF tells each client process whether it is active, and
 the framework enforces that in inactive processes calls on to the current
 InputConnection will be ignored.  This ensures that the current IME can
 only deliver events and text edits to the UI that the user sees as
 being in focus.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;An IME can never interact with an {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputConnection} while
 the screen is off.  This is enforced by making all clients inactive while
 the screen is off, and prevents bad IMEs from driving the UI when the user
 can not be aware of its behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;A client application can ask that the system let the user pick a
 new IME, but can not programmatically switch to one itself.  This avoids
 malicious applications from switching the user to their own IME, which
 remains running when the user navigates away to another application.  An
 IME, on the other hand, &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; allowed to programmatically switch
 the system to another IME, since it already has full control of user
 input.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The user must explicitly enable a new IME in settings before
 they can switch to it, to confirm with the system that they know about it
 and want to make it available for use.&lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Here are scenarios we know and there could be more scenarios we are not
 aware of right know.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Apps that directly access {@link #sInstance} via reflection, which is currently
     allowed because of {@link UnsupportedAppUsage} annotation.  Currently
     {@link android.view.WindowManagerGlobal#getWindowSession()} is likely to guarantee that
     {@link #sInstance} is not {@code null} when such an app is accessing it, but removing
     that code from {@link android.view.WindowManagerGlobal#getWindowSession()} can reveal
     untested code paths in their apps, which probably happen in an early startup time of that
     app.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Apps that directly access {@link #peekInstance}() via reflection, which is currently
     allowed because of {@link UnsupportedAppUsage} annotation.  Currently
     {@link android.view.WindowManagerGlobal#getWindowSession()} is likely to guarantee that
     {@link #peekInstance}() returns non-{@code null} object when such an app is calling
     {@link #peekInstance}(), but removing that code from
     {@link android.view.WindowManagerGlobal#getWindowSession()} can reveal untested code
     paths in their apps, which probably happen in an early startup time of that app. The good
     news is that unlike {@link #sInstance}'s case we can at least work around this scenario
     by changing the semantics of {@link #peekInstance}(), which is currently defined as
     &quot;retrieve the global {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodManager} instance, if it exists&quot; to something that
     always returns non-{@code null} {@link android.view.inputmethod.InputMethodManager}.  However, introducing such an
     workaround can also trigger different compatibility issues if {@link #peekInstance}() was
     called before {@link android.view.WindowManagerGlobal#getWindowSession()} and it expected
     {@link #peekInstance}() to return {@code null} as written in the JavaDoc.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Since this is purely a compatibility hack, this method must be used only from
 {@link android.view.WindowManagerGlobal#getWindowSession()} and {@link #getInstance}().&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;TODO(Bug 116157766): Remove this method once we clean up {@link UnsupportedAppUsage}.&lt;/p&gt;
