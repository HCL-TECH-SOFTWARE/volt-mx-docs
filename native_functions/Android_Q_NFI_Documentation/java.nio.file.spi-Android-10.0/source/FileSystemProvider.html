</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Service-provider class for file systems. The methods defined by the {@link java.nio.file.Files} class will typically delegate to an instance of this
 class.

 &lt;p&gt; A file system provider is a concrete implementation of this class that
 implements the abstract methods defined by this class. A provider is
 identified by a {@code URI} {@link #getScheme() scheme}. The default provider
 is identified by the URI scheme &quot;file&quot;. It creates the {@link FileSystem} that
 provides access to the file systems accessible to the Java virtual machine.
 The {@link FileSystems} class defines how file system providers are located
 and loaded. The default provider is typically a system-default provider but
 may be overridden if the system property {@code
 java.nio.file.spi.DefaultFileSystemProvider} is set. In that case, the
 provider has a one argument constructor whose formal parameter type is {@code
 FileSystemProvider}. All other providers have a zero argument constructor
 that initializes the provider.

 &lt;p&gt; A provider is a factory for one or more {@link FileSystem} instances. Each
 file system is identified by a {@code URI} where the URI's scheme matches
 the provider's {@link #getScheme scheme}. The default file system, for example,
 is identified by the URI {@code &quot;file:///&quot;}. A memory-based file system,
 for example, may be identified by a URI such as {@code &quot;memory:///?name=logfs&quot;}.
 The {@link #newFileSystem newFileSystem} method may be used to create a file
 system, and the {@link #getFileSystem getFileSystem} method may be used to
 obtain a reference to an existing file system created by the provider. Where
 a provider is the factory for a single file system then it is provider dependent
 if the file system is created when the provider is initialized, or later when
 the {@code newFileSystem} method is invoked. In the case of the default
 provider, the {@code FileSystem} is created when the provider is initialized.

 &lt;p&gt; All of the methods in this class are safe for use by multiple concurrent
 threads.

 machine has appropriate privileges that would allow it access the file
