</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Base class that provides the content of a document to be printed.

 &lt;h3&gt;Lifecycle&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;
 Initially, you will receive a call to {@link #onStart}(). This callback
 can be used to allocate resources.
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;
 Next, you will get one or more calls to {@link #onLayout(android.print.PrintAttributes,
 android.print.PrintAttributes, CancellationSignal, android.print.PrintDocumentAdapter.LayoutResultCallback, Bundle)} to
 inform you that the print attributes (page size, density, etc) changed
 giving you an opportunity to layout the content to match the new constraints.
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;
 After every call to {@link #onLayout(android.print.PrintAttributes, android.print.PrintAttributes,
 CancellationSignal, android.print.PrintDocumentAdapter.LayoutResultCallback, Bundle)}, you &lt;strong&gt;may&lt;/strong&gt; get
 a call to {@link #onWrite(PageRange[], ParcelFileDescriptor, CancellationSignal,
 android.print.PrintDocumentAdapter.WriteResultCallback)} asking you to write a PDF file with the content for
 specific pages.
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;
 Finally, you will receive a call to {@link #onFinish}(). You can use this
 callback to release resources allocated in {@link #onStart}().
 &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@link #onStart}() callback is always the first call you will receive and
 is useful for doing one time setup or resource allocation before printing. You
 will not receive a subsequent call here.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@link #onLayout(android.print.PrintAttributes, android.print.PrintAttributes, CancellationSignal,
 android.print.PrintDocumentAdapter.LayoutResultCallback, Bundle)} callback requires that you layout the content
 based on the current {@link android.print.PrintAttributes}. The execution of this method is
 not considered completed until you invoke one of the methods on the passed in
 callback instance. Hence, you will not receive a subsequent call to any other
 method of this class until the execution of this method is complete by invoking
 one of the callback methods.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@link #onWrite(PageRange[], ParcelFileDescriptor, CancellationSignal,
 android.print.PrintDocumentAdapter.WriteResultCallback)} requires that you render and write the content of some
 pages to the provided destination. The execution of this method is not
 considered complete until you invoke one of the methods on the passed in
 callback instance. Hence, you will not receive a subsequent call to any other
 method of this class until the execution of this method is complete by invoking
 one of the callback methods. You will never receive a sequence of one or more
 calls to this method without a previous call to {@link #onLayout(android.print.PrintAttributes,
 android.print.PrintAttributes, CancellationSignal, android.print.PrintDocumentAdapter.LayoutResultCallback, Bundle)}.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The {@link #onFinish}() callback is always the last call you will receive and
 is useful for doing one time cleanup or resource deallocation after printing.
 You will not receive a subsequent call here.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Implementation&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The APIs defined in this class are designed to enable doing part or all
 of the work on an arbitrary thread. For example, if the printed content
 does not depend on the UI state, i.e. on what is shown on the screen, then
 you can offload the entire work on a dedicated thread, thus making your
 application interactive while the print work is being performed. Note that
 while your activity is covered by the system print UI and a user cannot
 interact with it, doing the printing work on the main application thread
 may affect the performance of your other application components as they
 are also executed on that thread.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 You can also do work on different threads, for example if you print UI
 content, you can handle {@link #onStart}() and {@link #onLayout(android.print.PrintAttributes,
 android.print.PrintAttributes, CancellationSignal, android.print.PrintDocumentAdapter.LayoutResultCallback, Bundle)} on
 the UI thread (assuming onStart initializes resources needed for layout).
 This will ensure that the UI does not change while you are laying out the
 printed content. Then you can handle {@link #onWrite(PageRange[], ParcelFileDescriptor,
 CancellationSignal, android.print.PrintDocumentAdapter.WriteResultCallback)} and {@link #onFinish}() on another
 thread. This will ensure that the main thread is busy for a minimal amount of
 time. Also this assumes that you will generate the printed content in
 {@link #onLayout(android.print.PrintAttributes, android.print.PrintAttributes, CancellationSignal,
 android.print.PrintDocumentAdapter.LayoutResultCallback, Bundle)} which is not mandatory. If you use multiple
 threads, you are responsible for proper synchronization.
 &lt;/p&gt;

<span id='android-print-PrintDocumentAdapter-method-onLayout'>/**Called when the print attributes (page size, density, etc) changed
</span> giving you a chance to layout the content such that it matches the
 new constraints. This method is invoked on the main thread.
 &lt;p&gt;
 After you are done laying out, you &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; invoke: {@link android.print.PrintDocumentAdapter.LayoutResultCallback#onLayoutFinished(PrintDocumentInfo, boolean)} with
 the last argument &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;false&lt;/code&gt; depending on
 whether the layout changed the content or not, respectively; or {@link android.print.PrintDocumentAdapter.LayoutResultCallback#onLayoutFailed(CharSequence)}, if an error occurred;
 or {@link android.print.PrintDocumentAdapter.LayoutResultCallback#onLayoutCancelled()} if layout was
 cancelled in a response to a cancellation request via the passed in
 {@link CancellationSignal}. Note that you &lt;strong&gt;must&lt;/strong&gt; call one of
 the methods of the given callback for this method to be considered complete
 which is you will not receive any calls to this adapter until the current
 layout operation is complete by invoking a method on the callback instance.
 The callback methods can be invoked from an arbitrary thread.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 One of the arguments passed to this method is a {@link CancellationSignal}
 which is used to propagate requests from the system to your application for
 canceling the current layout operation. For example, a cancellation may be
 requested if the user changes a print option that may affect layout while
 you are performing a layout operation. In such a case the system will make
 an attempt to cancel the current layout as another one will have to be performed.
 Typically, you should register a cancellation callback in the cancellation
 signal. The cancellation callback &lt;strong&gt;will not&lt;/strong&gt; be made on the
 main thread and can be registered as follows:
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;pre&gt;
 cancellationSignal.setOnCancelListener(new OnCancelListener() {
     &amp;#064;Override
     public void onCancel() {
         // Cancel layout
     }
 });
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If the content is large and a layout will be
 performed, it is a good practice to schedule the work on a dedicated
 thread and register an observer in the provided {@link CancellationSignal} upon invocation of which you should stop the
 layout.
 &lt;/p&gt;

@param {Object {PrintAttributes}} newAttributes The new print attributes.

<span id='android-print-PrintDocumentAdapter-method-onWrite'>/**Called when specific pages of the content should be written in the
</span> form of a PDF file to the given file descriptor. This method is invoked
 on the main thread.
&lt;p&gt;
 After you are done writing, you should close the file descriptor and
 invoke {@link android.print.PrintDocumentAdapter.WriteResultCallback#onWriteFinished(PageRange[])}, if writing
 completed successfully; or {@link android.print.PrintDocumentAdapter.WriteResultCallback#onWriteFailed(
 CharSequence)}, if an error occurred; or {@link android.print.PrintDocumentAdapter.WriteResultCallback#onWriteCancelled()},
 if writing was cancelled in a response to a cancellation request via the passed

 the methods of the given callback for this method to be considered complete which
 is you will not receive any calls to this adapter until the current write
 operation is complete by invoking a method on the callback instance. The callback
 methods can be invoked from an arbitrary thread.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 One of the arguments passed to this method is a {@link CancellationSignal}
 which is used to propagate requests from the system to your application for
 canceling the current write operation. For example, a cancellation may be
 requested if the user changes a print option that may affect layout while
 you are performing a write operation. In such a case the system will make
 an attempt to cancel the current write as a layout will have to be performed
 which then may be followed by a write. Typically, you should register a
 cancellation callback in the cancellation signal. The cancellation callback
 &lt;strong&gt;will not&lt;/strong&gt; be made on the main thread and can be registered
 as follows:
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;pre&gt;
