</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 This class provides the APIs to manage configured Wi-Fi networks.
 It deals with the following:
 - Maintaining a list of configured networks for quick access.
 - Persisting the configurations to store when required.
 - Supporting WifiManager Public API calls:
   &gt; addOrUpdateNetwork()
   &gt; removeNetwork()
   &gt; enableNetwork()
   &gt; disableNetwork()
 - Handle user switching on multi-user devices.

 All network configurations retrieved from this class are copies of the original configuration
 stored in the internal database. So, any updates to the retrieved configuration object are
 meaningless and will not be reflected in the original database.
 This is done on purpose to ensure that only WifiConfigManager can modify configurations stored
 in the internal database. Any configuration updates should be triggered with appropriate helper
 methods of this class using the configuration's unique networkId.

 NOTE: These API's are not thread safe and should only be used from ClientModeImpl thread.
