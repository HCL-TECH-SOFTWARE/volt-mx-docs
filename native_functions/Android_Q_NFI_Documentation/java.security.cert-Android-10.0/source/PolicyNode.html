</span> An immutable valid policy tree node as defined by the PKIX certification
 path validation algorithm.

 &lt;p&gt;One of the outputs of the PKIX certification path validation
 algorithm is a valid policy tree, which includes the policies that
 were determined to be valid, how this determination was reached,
 and any policy qualifiers encountered. This tree is of depth
 &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is the length of the certification
 path that has been validated.

 &lt;p&gt;Most applications will not need to examine the valid policy tree.
 They can achieve their policy processing goals by setting the
 policy-related parameters in {@code PKIXParameters}. However,
 the valid policy tree is available for more sophisticated applications,
 especially those that process policy qualifiers.

 &lt;p&gt;{@link java.security.cert.PKIXCertPathValidatorResult#getPolicyTree()
 java.security.cert.PKIXCertPathValidatorResult.getPolicyTree} returns the root node of the
 valid policy tree. The tree can be traversed using the
 {@link #getChildren getChildren} and {@link #getParent getParent} methods.
 Data about a particular node can be retrieved using other methods of
 {@code PolicyNode}.

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Concurrent Access&lt;/b&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;All {@code PolicyNode} objects must be immutable and
 thread-safe. Multiple threads may concurrently invoke the methods defined
 in this class on a single {@code PolicyNode} object (or more than one)
 with no ill effects. This stipulation applies to all public fields and
 methods of this class and any added or overridden by subclasses.
