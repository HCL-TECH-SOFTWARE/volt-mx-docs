 This class defines the &lt;i&gt;Service Provider Interface&lt;/i&gt; (&lt;b&gt;SPI&lt;/b&gt;)
 for the {@code CertificateFactory} class.
 All the abstract methods in this class must be implemented by each
 cryptographic service provider who wishes to supply the implementation
 of a certificate factory for a particular certificate type, e.g., X.509.

 &lt;p&gt;Certificate factories are used to generate certificate, certification path
 ({@code CertPath}) and certificate revocation list (CRL) objects from
 their encodings.

 &lt;p&gt;A certificate factory for X.509 must return certificates that are an
 instance of {@code java.security.cert.X509Certificate}, and CRLs
 that are an instance of {@code java.security.cert.X509CRL}.

 factory implements X.509 certificates, the returned certificate object
 can be typecast to the {@code X509Certificate} class.

 &lt;p&gt;In the case of a certificate factory for X.509 certificates, the
 certificate provided in {@code inStream} must be DER-encoded and
