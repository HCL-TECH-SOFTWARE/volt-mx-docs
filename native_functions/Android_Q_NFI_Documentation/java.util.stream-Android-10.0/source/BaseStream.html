</span> implements java.lang.AutoCloseable

 Base interface for streams, which are sequences of elements supporting
 sequential and parallel aggregate operations.  The following example
 illustrates an aggregate operation using the stream types {@link java.util.stream.Stream}
 and {@link java.util.stream.IntStream}, computing the sum of the weights of the red widgets:

 &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     int sum = widgets.stream()
                      .filter(w -&gt; w.getColor() == RED)
                      .mapToInt(w -&gt; w.getWeight())
                      .sum();
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

 See the class documentation for {@link java.util.stream.Stream} and the package documentation
 for &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html&quot;&gt;java.util.stream&lt;/a&gt; for additional
 specification of streams, stream operations, stream pipelines, and
 parallelism, which governs the behavior of all stream types.
