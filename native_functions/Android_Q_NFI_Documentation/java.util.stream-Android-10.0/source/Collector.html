</span> A &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#Reduction&quot;&gt;mutable reduction operation&lt;/a&gt; that
 accumulates input elements into a mutable result container, optionally transforming
 the accumulated result into a final representation after all input elements
 have been processed.  Reduction operations can be performed either sequentially
 or in parallel.

 &lt;p&gt;Examples of mutable reduction operations include:
 accumulating elements into a {@code Collection}; concatenating
 strings using a {@code StringBuilder}; computing summary information about
 elements such as sum, min, max, or average; computing &quot;pivot table&quot; summaries
 such as &quot;maximum valued transaction by seller&quot;, etc.  The class {@link java.util.stream.Collectors}
 provides implementations of many common mutable reductions.

 &lt;p&gt;A {@code Collector} is specified by four functions that work together to
 accumulate entries into a mutable result container, and optionally perform
 a final transform on the result.  They are: &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;creation of a new result container ({@link #supplier}())&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;incorporating a new data element into a result container ({@link #accumulator}())&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;combining two result containers into one ({@link #combiner}())&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;performing an optional final transform on the container ({@link #finisher}())&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Collectors also have a set of characteristics, such as
 {@link java.util.stream.Collector.Characteristics#CONCURRENT}, that provide hints that can be used by a
 reduction implementation to provide better performance.

 &lt;p&gt;A sequential implementation of a reduction using a collector would
 create a single result container using the supplier function, and invoke the
 accumulator function once for each input element.  A parallel implementation
 would partition the input, create a result container for each partition,
 accumulate the contents of each partition into a subresult for that partition,
 and then use the combiner function to merge the subresults into a combined
 result.

 &lt;p&gt;To ensure that sequential and parallel executions produce equivalent
 results, the collector functions must satisfy an &lt;em&gt;identity&lt;/em&gt; and an
 &lt;a href=&quot;package-summary.html#Associativity&quot;&gt;associativity&lt;/a&gt; constraints.

 &lt;p&gt;The identity constraint says that for any partially accumulated result,
 combining it with an empty result container must produce an equivalent
 result.  That is, for a partially accumulated result {@code a} that is the
 result of any series of accumulator and combiner invocations, {@code a} must
 be equivalent to {@code combiner.apply(a, supplier.get())}.

 &lt;p&gt;The associativity constraint says that splitting the computation must
 produce an equivalent result.  That is, for any input elements {@code t1}
 and {@code t2}, the results {@code r1} and {@code r2} in the computation
 below must be equivalent:
 &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     A a1 = supplier.get();
     accumulator.accept(a1, t1);
     accumulator.accept(a1, t2);
     R r1 = finisher.apply(a1);  // result without splitting

     A a2 = supplier.get();
     accumulator.accept(a2, t1);
     A a3 = supplier.get();
     accumulator.accept(a3, t2);
     R r2 = finisher.apply(combiner.apply(a2, a3));  // result with splitting
 } &lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;For collectors that do not have the {@code UNORDERED} characteristic,
 two accumulated results {@code a1} and {@code a2} are equivalent if
 {@code finisher.apply(a1).equals(finisher.apply(a2))}.  For unordered
 collectors, equivalence is relaxed to allow for non-equality related to
 differences in order.  (For example, an unordered collector that accumulated
 elements to a {@code List} would consider two lists equivalent if they
 contained the same elements, ignoring order.)

 &lt;p&gt;Libraries that implement reduction based on {@code Collector}, such as
 {@link java.util.stream.Stream#collect(Collector)}, must adhere to the following constraints:
 &lt;ul&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;The first argument passed to the accumulator function, both
     arguments passed to the combiner function, and the argument passed to the
     finisher function must be the result of a previous invocation of the
     result supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;The implementation should not do anything with the result of any of
     the result supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions other than to
     pass them again to the accumulator, combiner, or finisher functions,
     or return them to the caller of the reduction operation.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;If a result is passed to the combiner or finisher
     function, and the same object is not returned from that function, it is
     never used again.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;Once a result is passed to the combiner or finisher function, it
     is never passed to the accumulator function again.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;For non-concurrent collectors, any result returned from the result
     supplier, accumulator, or combiner functions must be serially
     thread-confined.  This enables collection to occur in parallel without
     the {@code Collector} needing to implement any additional synchronization.
     The reduction implementation must manage that the input is properly
     partitioned, that partitions are processed in isolation, and combining
     happens only after accumulation is complete.&lt;/li&gt;
     &lt;li&gt;For concurrent collectors, an implementation is free to (but not
     required to) implement reduction concurrently.  A concurrent reduction
     is one where the accumulator function is called concurrently from
     multiple threads, using the same concurrently-modifiable result container,
     rather than keeping the result isolated during accumulation.
     A concurrent reduction should only be applied if the collector has the
     {@link java.util.stream.Collector.Characteristics#UNORDERED} characteristics or if the
     originating data is unordered.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;In addition to the predefined implementations in {@link java.util.stream.Collectors}, the
 static factory methods {@link #of(Supplier, BiConsumer, BinaryOperator, java.util.stream.Collector.Characteristics...)}
 can be used to construct collectors.  For example, you could create a collector
 that accumulates widgets into a {@code TreeSet} with:

 &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     Collector&lt;Widget, ?, TreeSet&lt;Widget&gt;&gt; intoSet =
         Collector.of(TreeSet::new, TreeSet::add,
                      (left, right) -&gt; { left.addAll(right); return left; });
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

 (This behavior is also implemented by the predefined collector
 {@link java.util.stream.Collectors#toCollection(Supplier)}).

 @apiNote
 Performing a reduction operation with a {@code Collector} should produce a
 result equivalent to:
 &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     R container = collector.supplier().get();
     for (T t : data)
         collector.accumulator().accept(container, t);
     return collector.finisher().apply(container);
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;However, the library is free to partition the input, perform the reduction
 on the partitions, and then use the combiner function to combine the partial
 results to achieve a parallel reduction.  (Depending on the specific reduction
 operation, this may perform better or worse, depending on the relative cost
 of the accumulator and combiner functions.)

 &lt;p&gt;Collectors are designed to be &lt;em&gt;composed&lt;/em&gt;; many of the methods
 in {@link java.util.stream.Collectors} are functions that take a collector and produce
 a new collector.  For example, given the following collector that computes
 the sum of the salaries of a stream of employees:

 &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     Collector&lt;Employee, ?, Integer&gt; summingSalaries
         = Collectors.summingInt(Employee::getSalary))
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

 If we wanted to create a collector to tabulate the sum of salaries by
 department, we could reuse the &quot;sum of salaries&quot; logic using
 {@link java.util.stream.Collectors#groupingBy(Function, Collector)}:

 &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     Collector&lt;Employee, ?, Map&lt;Department, Integer&gt;&gt; summingSalariesByDept
         = Collectors.groupingBy(Employee::getDepartment, summingSalaries);
 }&lt;/pre&gt;
