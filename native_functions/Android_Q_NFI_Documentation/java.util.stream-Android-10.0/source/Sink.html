</span> implements java.util.function.Consumer

 An extension of {@link Consumer} used to conduct values through the stages of
 a stream pipeline, with additional methods to manage size information,
 control flow, etc.  Before calling the {@code accept()} method on a
 {@code Sink} for the first time, you must first call the {@code begin()}
 method to inform it that data is coming (optionally informing the sink how
 much data is coming), and after all data has been sent, you must call the
 {@code end()} method.  After calling {@code end()}, you should not call
 {@code accept()} without again calling {@code begin()}.  {@code Sink} also
 offers a mechanism by which the sink can cooperatively signal that it does
 not wish to receive any more data (the {@code cancellationRequested()}
 method), which a source can poll before sending more data to the
 {@code Sink}.

 &lt;p&gt;A sink may be in one of two states: an initial state and an active state.
 It starts out in the initial state; the {@code begin()} method transitions
 it to the active state, and the {@code end()} method transitions it back into
 the initial state, where it can be re-used.  Data-accepting methods (such as
 {@code accept()} are only valid in the active state.

 @apiNote
 A stream pipeline consists of a source, zero or more intermediate stages
 (such as filtering or mapping), and a terminal stage, such as reduction or
 for-each.  For concreteness, consider the pipeline:

 &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     int longestStringLengthStartingWithA
         = strings.stream()
                  .filter(s -&gt; s.startsWith(&quot;A&quot;))
                  .mapToInt(String::length)
                  .max();
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Here, we have three stages, filtering, mapping, and reducing.  The
 filtering stage consumes strings and emits a subset of those strings; the
 mapping stage consumes strings and emits ints; the reduction stage consumes
 those ints and computes the maximal value.

 &lt;p&gt;A {@code Sink} instance is used to represent each stage of this pipeline,
 whether the stage accepts objects, ints, longs, or doubles.  Sink has entry
 points for {@code accept(Object)}, {@code accept(int)}, etc, so that we do
 not need a specialized interface for each primitive specialization.  (It
 might be called a &quot;kitchen sink&quot; for this omnivorous tendency.)  The entry
 point to the pipeline is the {@code Sink} for the filtering stage, which
 sends some elements &quot;downstream&quot; -- into the {@code Sink} for the mapping
 stage, which in turn sends integral values downstream into the {@code Sink}
 for the reduction stage. The {@code Sink} implementations associated with a
 given stage is expected to know the data type for the next stage, and call
 the correct {@code accept} method on its downstream {@code Sink}.  Similarly,
 each stage must implement the correct {@code accept} method corresponding to
 the data type it accepts.

 &lt;p&gt;The specialized subtypes such as {@link java.util.stream.Sink.OfInt} override
 {@code accept(Object)} to call the appropriate primitive specialization of
 {@code accept}, implement the appropriate primitive specialization of
 {@code Consumer}, and re-abstract the appropriate primitive specialization of
 {@code accept}.

 &lt;p&gt;The chaining subtypes such as {@link java.util.stream.Sink.ChainedInt} not only implement
 {@code Sink.OfInt}, but also maintain a {@code downstream} field which
 represents the downstream {@code Sink}, and implement the methods
 {@code begin()}, {@code end()}, and {@code cancellationRequested()} to
 delegate to the downstream {@code Sink}.  Most implementations of
 intermediate operations will use these chaining wrappers.  For example, the
 mapping stage in the above example would look like:

 &lt;pre&gt;{@code
     IntSink is = new Sink.ChainedReference&lt;U&gt;(sink) {
         public void accept(U u) {
             downstream.accept(mapper.applyAsInt(u));
         }
     };
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Here, we implement {@code Sink.ChainedReference&lt;U&gt;}, meaning that we expect
 to receive elements of type {@code U} as input, and pass the downstream sink
 to the constructor.  Because the next stage expects to receive integers, we
 must call the {@code accept(int)} method when emitting values to the downstream.
 The {@code accept()} method applies the mapping function from {@code U} to
 {@code int} and passes the resulting value to the downstream {@code Sink}.
