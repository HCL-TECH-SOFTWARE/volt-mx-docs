 The rules defining how the zone offset varies for a single time-zone.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The rules model all the historic and future transitions for a time-zone.
 {@link java.time.zone.ZoneOffsetTransition} is used for known transitions, typically historic.
 {@link java.time.zone.ZoneOffsetTransitionRule} is used for future transitions that are based
 on the result of an algorithm.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The same rules may be shared internally between multiple zone IDs.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Serializing an instance of {@code ZoneRules} will store the entire set of rules.
 It does not store the zone ID as it is not part of the state of this object.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A rule implementation may or may not store full information about historic
 and future transitions, and the information stored is only as accurate as
 that supplied to the implementation by the rules provider.
 Applications should treat the data provided as representing the best information
 available to the implementation of this rule.

</span> &lt;p&gt;
 The mapping from a local date-time to an offset is not straightforward.
 There are three cases:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal
  case applies, where there is a single valid offset for the local date-time.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Gap, with zero valid offsets. This is when clocks jump forward typically
  due to the spring daylight savings change from &quot;winter&quot; to &quot;summer&quot;.
  In a gap there are local date-time values with no valid offset.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Overlap, with two valid offsets. This is when clocks are set back typically
  due to the autumn daylight savings change from &quot;summer&quot; to &quot;winter&quot;.
  In an overlap there are local date-time values with two valid offsets.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 Thus, for any given local date-time there can be zero, one or two valid offsets.
 This method returns the single offset in the Normal case, and in the Gap or Overlap
 case it returns the offset before the transition.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Since, in the case of Gap and Overlap, the offset returned is a &quot;best&quot; value, rather
 than the &quot;correct&quot; value, it should be treated with care. Applications that care
 about the correct offset should use a combination of this method,
 {@link #getValidOffsets}(LocalDateTime) and {@link #getTransition}(LocalDateTime).
@param {Object {LocalDateTime}} localDateTime  the local date-time to query, not null, but null
  may be ignored if the rules have a single offset for all instants
@return {Object {java.time.ZoneOffset}} the best available offset for the local date-time, not null

 The mapping from a local date-time to an offset is not straightforward.
 There are three cases:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Normal, with one valid offset. For the vast majority of the year, the normal
  case applies, where there is a single valid offset for the local date-time.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Gap, with zero valid offsets. This is when clocks jump forward typically

  due to the autumn daylight savings change from &quot;summer&quot; to &quot;winter&quot;.
  In an overlap there are local date-time values with two valid offsets.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 Thus, for any given local date-time there can be zero, one or two valid offsets.
 This method returns that list of valid offsets, which is a list of size 0, 1 or 2.
 In the case where there are two offsets, the earlier offset is returned at index 0
 and the later offset at index 1.
 &lt;p&gt;
 There are various ways to handle the conversion from a {@code LocalDateTime}.
 One technique, using this method, would be:
 &lt;pre&gt;
  List&amp;lt;ZoneOffset&amp;gt; validOffsets = rules.getOffset(localDT);
  if (validOffsets.size() == 1) {
    // Normal case: only one valid offset
    zoneOffset = validOffsets.get(0);
  } else {
    // Gap or Overlap: determine what to do from transition (which will be non-null)
    ZoneOffsetTransition trans = rules.getTransition(localDT);
  }
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 In theory, it is possible for there to be more than two valid offsets.
 This would happen if clocks to be put back more than once in quick succession.
 This has never happened in the history of time-zones and thus has no special handling.
 However, if it were to happen, then the list would return more than 2 entries.
@param {Object {LocalDateTime}} localDateTime  the local date-time to query for valid offsets, not null, but null
