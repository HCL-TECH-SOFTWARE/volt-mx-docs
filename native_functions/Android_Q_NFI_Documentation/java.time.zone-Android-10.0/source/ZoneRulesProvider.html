</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Provider of time-zone rules to the system.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This class manages the configuration of time-zone rules.
 The static methods provide the public API that can be used to manage the providers.
 The abstract methods provide the SPI that allows rules to be provided.
 &lt;p&gt;
 ZoneRulesProvider may be installed in an instance of the Java Platform as
 extension classes, that is, jar files placed into any of the usual extension
 directories. Installed providers are loaded using the service-provider loading
 facility defined by the {@link ServiceLoader} class. A ZoneRulesProvider
 identifies itself with a provider configuration file named
 {@code java.time.zone.ZoneRulesProvider} in the resource directory
 {@code META-INF/services}. The file should contain a line that specifies the
 fully qualified concrete zonerules-provider class name.
 Providers may also be made available by adding them to the class path or by
 registering themselves via {@link #registerProvider} method.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The Java virtual machine has a default provider that provides zone rules
 for the time-zones defined by IANA Time Zone Database (TZDB). If the system
 property {@code java.time.zone.DefaultZoneRulesProvider} is defined then
 it is taken to be the fully-qualified name of a concrete ZoneRulesProvider
 class to be loaded as the default provider, using the system class loader.
 If this system property is not defined, a system-default provider will be
 loaded to serve as the default provider.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Rules are looked up primarily by zone ID, as used by {@link ZoneId}.
 Only zone region IDs may be used, zone offset IDs are not used here.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Time-zone rules are political, thus the data can change at any time.
 Each provider will provide the latest rules for each zone ID, but they
 may also provide the history of how the rules changed.

 @implSpec
 This interface is a service provider that can be called by multiple threads.
 Implementations must be immutable and thread-safe.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Providers must ensure that once a rule has been seen by the application, the
 rule must continue to be available.
 &lt;p&gt;
  Providers are encouraged to implement a meaningful {@code toString} method.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Many systems would like to update time-zone rules dynamically without stopping the JVM.
 When examined in detail, this is a complex problem.
 Providers may choose to handle dynamic updates, however the default provider does not.

</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This returns the latest available rules for the zone ID.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This method relies on time-zone data provider files that are configured.
 These are loaded using a {@code ServiceLoader}.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The caching flag is designed to allow provider implementations to
 prevent the rules being cached in {@code ZoneId}.
 Under normal circumstances, the caching of zone rules is highly desirable
 as it will provide greater performance. However, there is a use case where
 the caching would not be desirable, see {@link #provideRules}.
@param {String} zoneId the zone ID as defined by {@code ZoneId}, not null

 true if the returned rules will be cached by {@code ZoneId},
 false if they will be returned to the user without being cached in {@code ZoneId}
@return {Object {java.time.zone.ZoneRules}} the rules, null if {@code forCaching} is true and this
 is a dynamic provider that wants to prevent caching in {@code ZoneId},
 otherwise not null

<span id='java-time-zone-ZoneRulesProvider-method-getVersions'>/**Gets the history of rules for the zone ID.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 Time-zones are defined by governments and change frequently.
 This method allows applications to find the history of changes to the
 rules for a single zone ID. The map is keyed by a string, which is the
 version string associated with the rules.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The exact meaning and format of the version is provider specific.
 The version must follow lexicographical order, thus the returned map will
 be order from the oldest known rules to the newest available rules.
 The default 'TZDB' group uses version numbering consisting of the year
 followed by a letter, such as '2009e' or '2012f'.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Implementations must provide a result for each valid zone ID, however
 they do not have to provide a history of rules.
 Thus the map will always contain one element, and will only contain more
 than one element if historical rule information is available.
@param {String} zoneId  the zone ID as defined by {@code ZoneId}, not null
@return {Object {java.util.NavigableMap}} a modifiable copy of the history of the rules for the ID, sorted
  from oldest to newest, not null
@throws ZoneRulesException if history cannot be obtained for the zone ID

<span id='java-time-zone-ZoneRulesProvider-method-registerProvider'>/**Registers a zone rules provider.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This adds a new provider to those currently available.
 A provider supplies rules for one or more zone IDs.
 A provider cannot be registered if it supplies a zone ID that has already been
 registered. See the notes on time-zone IDs in {@link ZoneId}, especially
 the section on using the concept of a &quot;group&quot; to make IDs unique.
 &lt;p&gt;
 To ensure the integrity of time-zones already created, there is no way
 to deregister providers.
@param {Object {ZoneRulesProvider}} provider  the provider to register, not null
@throws ZoneRulesException if a zone ID is already registered

registerProvider : function(  ) {},

<span id='java-time-zone-ZoneRulesProvider-method-refresh'>/**Refreshes the rules from the underlying data provider.
</span> &lt;p&gt;
 This method allows an application to request that the providers check
 for any updates to the provided rules.
 After calling this method, the offset stored in any {@link ZonedDateTime}
 may be invalid for the zone ID.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Dynamic update of rules is a complex problem and most applications
 should not use this method or dynamic rules.
 To achieve dynamic rules, a provider implementation will have to be written
 as per the specification of this class.
 In addition, instances of {@code ZoneRules} must not be cached in the
 application as they will become stale. However, the boolean flag on
 {@link #provideRules(String, boolean)} allows provider implementations
 to control the caching of {@code ZoneId}, potentially ensuring that
 all objects in the system see the new rules.
 Note that there is likely to be a cost in performance of a dynamic rules
 provider. Note also that no dynamic rules provider is in this specification.
@return {Boolean} true if the rules were updated
@throws ZoneRulesException if an error occurs during the refresh
