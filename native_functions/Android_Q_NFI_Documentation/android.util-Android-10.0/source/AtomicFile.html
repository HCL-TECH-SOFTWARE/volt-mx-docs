</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Helper class for performing atomic operations on a file by creating a
 backup file until a write has successfully completed.  If you need this
 on older versions of the platform you can use
 {@link android.support.v4.util.AtomicFile} in the v4 support library.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Atomic file guarantees file integrity by ensuring that a file has
 been completely written and sync'd to disk before removing its backup.
 As long as the backup file exists, the original file is considered
 to be invalid (left over from a previous attempt to write the file).
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 Atomic file does not confer any file locking semantics.
 Do not use this class when the file may be accessed or modified concurrently
 by multiple threads or processes.  The caller is responsible for ensuring
 appropriate mutual exclusion invariants whenever it accesses the file.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 FileOutputStream; instead call either {@link #finishWrite}(FileOutputStream)
 or {@link #failWrite}(FileOutputStream).

 &lt;p&gt;Note that if another thread is currently performing
 a write, this will simply replace whatever that thread is writing
 with the new file being written by this thread, and when the other
 thread finishes the write the new write operation will no longer be
 safe (or will be lost).  You must do your own threading protection for
 access to AtomicFile.
