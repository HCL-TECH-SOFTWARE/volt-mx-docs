 A group of kernels that are executed
 together with one execution call as if they were a single kernel
 &lt;p&gt;
 In addition to kernels, a script group may contain invocable functions as well.
 A script group may take inputs and generate outputs, which are consumed and
 produced by its member kernels.
 Inside a script group, outputs from one kernel can be passed to another kernel as inputs.
 The API disallows cyclic dependencies among kernels in a script group,
 effectively making it a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of kernels.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Grouping kernels together allows for more efficient execution. For example,
 runtime and compiler optimization can be applied to reduce computation and
 communication overhead, and to make better use of the CPU and the GPU.
