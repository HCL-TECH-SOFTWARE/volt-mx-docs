 Allows an application to receive Wifi Multicast packets.
 Normally the Wifi stack filters out packets not explicitly
 addressed to this device.  Acquring a MulticastLock will
 cause the stack to receive packets addressed to multicast
 addresses.  Processing these extra packets can cause a noticeable
 battery drain and should be disabled when not needed.

 If this MulticastLock is reference-counted each call to
 {@code acquire} will increment the reference count, and the
 wifi interface will receive multicast packets as long as the
 reference count is above zero.

 If this MulticastLock is not reference-counted, the first call to
 {@code acquire} will turn on the multicast packets, but subsequent
 calls will be ignored.  Only one call to {@link #release} will
 be required, regardless of the number of times that {@code acquire}
 is called.

 Note that other applications may also lock Wifi Multicast on.
 Only they can relinquish their lock.

 Also note that applications cannot leave Multicast locked on.
 When an app exits or crashes, any Multicast locks will be released.

 is, if {@code release} is called a greater number of times than
 {@link #acquire}), an exception is thrown.

 If this MulticastLock is not reference-counted, the first call to
 {@code release} (after the radio was multicast locked using
 {@link #acquire}) will unlock the multicast, and subsequent calls

 Note that if any other Wifi Multicast Locks are still outstanding
 this {@code release} call will not have an immediate effect.  Only
 when all applications have released all their Multicast Locks will
 the Multicast filter be turned back on.

 Also note that when an app exits or crashes all of its Multicast
