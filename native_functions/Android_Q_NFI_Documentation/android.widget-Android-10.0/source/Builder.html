 overlay with 5% alpha, aiming to make the magnifier distinguishable when shown in dark
 application regions. To disable the overlay, the parameter should be set
 to {@code null}. If not null, the overlay will be automatically redrawn

 the area where the magnifier can be positioned will no longer be clipped, so the
 magnifier will be able to extend outside the main application window boundaries (and also
 overlap the system insets). This can be useful if you require a custom behavior, but it
 should be handled with care, when passing coordinates to {@link #show(float, float)};

<span id='android-widget-Magnifier-Builder-method-setSourceBounds'>/**Defines the bounds of the rectangle where the magnifier will be able to copy its content
</span> from. The content will always be copied from the {@link Surface} of the main application
 window unless the magnified view is a {@link SurfaceView}, in which case its backing
 surface will be used. Each bound can have a different behavior, with the options being:
 &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;{@link #SOURCE_BOUND_MAX_VISIBLE}, which extends the bound as much as possible
   while remaining in the visible region of the magnified view, as given by
   {@link android.view.View#getGlobalVisibleRect(Rect)}. For example, this will take into
   account the case when the view is contained in a scrollable container, and the
   magnifier will refuse to copy content outside of the visible view region&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;{@link #SOURCE_BOUND_MAX_IN_SURFACE}, which extends the bound as much
   as possible while remaining inside the surface the content is copied from.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 Note that if either of the first three options is used, the bound will be compared to
 the bound of the surface (i.e. as if {@link #SOURCE_BOUND_MAX_IN_SURFACE} was used),
 and the more restrictive one will be chosen. In other words, no attempt to copy content
 from outside the surface will be permitted. If two opposite bounds are not well-behaved
 (i.e. left + sourceWidth &gt; right or top + sourceHeight &gt; bottom), the left and top
 bounds will have priority and the others will be extended accordingly. If the pairs
 obtained this way still remain out of bounds, the smallest possible offset will be added
 to the pairs to bring them inside the surface bounds. If this is impossible
 (i.e. the surface is too small for the size of the content we try to copy on either
 dimension), an error will be logged and the magnifier content will look distorted.
 The default values assumed by the builder for the source bounds are
 left: {@link #SOURCE_BOUND_MAX_VISIBLE}, top: {@link #SOURCE_BOUND_MAX_IN_SURFACE},
 right: {@link #SOURCE_BOUND_MAX_VISIBLE}, bottom: {@link #SOURCE_BOUND_MAX_IN_SURFACE}.
@param {Number} left the left bound for content copy
@param {Number} top the top bound for content copy
@param {Number} right the right bound for content copy
