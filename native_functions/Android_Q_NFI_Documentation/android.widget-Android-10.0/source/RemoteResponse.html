 Instead a single PendingIntent template can be set on the collection, see {@link android.widget.RemoteViews#setPendingIntentTemplate(int, PendingIntent)}, and the individual on-click
 action of a given item can be distinguished by setting a fillInIntent on that item. The
 fillInIntent is then combined with the PendingIntent template in order to determine the
 final intent which will be executed when the item is clicked. This works as follows: any
 fields which are left blank in the PendingIntent template, but are provided by the
 fillInIntent will be overwritten, and the resulting PendingIntent will be used. The rest
 of the PendingIntent template will then be filled in with the associated fields that are
 set in fillInIntent. See {@link Intent#fillIn(Intent, int)} for more details.
