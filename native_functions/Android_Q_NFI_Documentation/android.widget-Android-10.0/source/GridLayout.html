</span>@extends android.view.ViewGroup

 A layout that places its children in a rectangular &lt;em&gt;grid&lt;/em&gt;.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The grid is composed of a set of infinitely thin lines that separate the
 viewing area into &lt;em&gt;cells&lt;/em&gt;. Throughout the API, grid lines are referenced
 by grid &lt;em&gt;indices&lt;/em&gt;. A grid with {@code N} columns
 has {@code N + 1} grid indices that run from {@code 0}
 through {@code N} inclusive. Regardless of how GridLayout is
 configured, grid index {@code 0} is fixed to the leading edge of the
 container and grid index {@code N} is fixed to its trailing edge
 (after padding is taken into account).

 &lt;h4&gt;Row and Column Specs&lt;/h4&gt;

 Children occupy one or more contiguous cells, as defined
 by their {@link android.widget.GridLayout.LayoutParams#rowSpec rowSpec} and
 {@link android.widget.GridLayout.LayoutParams#columnSpec columnSpec} layout parameters.
 Each spec defines the set of rows or columns that are to be
 occupied; and how children should be aligned within the resulting group of cells.
 Although cells do not normally overlap in a GridLayout, GridLayout does
 not prevent children being defined to occupy the same cell or group of cells.
 In this case however, there is no guarantee that children will not themselves
 overlap after the layout operation completes.

 &lt;h4&gt;Default Cell Assignment&lt;/h4&gt;

 If a child does not specify the row and column indices of the cell it
 wishes to occupy, GridLayout assigns cell locations automatically using its:
 {@link android.widget.GridLayout#setOrientation(int) orientation},
 {@link android.widget.GridLayout#setRowCount(int) rowCount} and
 {@link android.widget.GridLayout#setColumnCount(int) columnCount} properties.

 &lt;h4&gt;Space&lt;/h4&gt;

 Space between children may be specified either by using instances of the
 dedicated {@link android.widget.Space} view or by setting the

 {@link ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams#leftMargin leftMargin},
 {@link ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams#topMargin topMargin},
 {@link ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams#rightMargin rightMargin} and
 {@link ViewGroup.MarginLayoutParams#bottomMargin bottomMargin}

 layout parameters. When the
 {@link android.widget.GridLayout#setUseDefaultMargins(boolean) useDefaultMargins}
 property is set, default margins around children are automatically
 allocated based on the prevailing UI style guide for the platform.
 Each of the margins so defined may be independently overridden by an assignment
 to the appropriate layout parameter.
 Default values will generally produce a reasonable spacing between components
 but values may change between different releases of the platform.

 &lt;h4&gt;Excess Space Distribution&lt;/h4&gt;

 As of API 21, GridLayout's distribution of excess space accomodates the principle of weight.
 In the event that no weights are specified, the previous conventions are respected and
 columns and rows are taken as flexible if their views specify some form of alignment
 within their groups.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The flexibility of a view is therefore influenced by its alignment which is,
 in turn, typically defined by setting the
 {@link android.widget.AbsListView.LayoutParams#setGravity(int) gravity} property of the child's layout parameters.
 If either a weight or alignment were defined along a given axis then the component
 is taken as &lt;em&gt;flexible&lt;/em&gt; in that direction. If no weight or alignment was set,
 the component is instead assumed to be &lt;em&gt;inflexible&lt;/em&gt;.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Multiple components in the same row or column group are
 considered to act in &lt;em&gt;parallel&lt;/em&gt;. Such a
 group is flexible only if &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; of the components
 within it are flexible. Row and column groups that sit either side of a common boundary
 are instead considered to act in &lt;em&gt;series&lt;/em&gt;. The composite group made of these two
 elements is flexible if &lt;em&gt;one&lt;/em&gt; of its elements is flexible.
 &lt;p&gt;
 To make a column stretch, make sure all of the components inside it define a
 weight or a gravity. To prevent a column from stretching, ensure that one of the components
 in the column does not define a weight or a gravity.
 &lt;p&gt;
 When the principle of flexibility does not provide complete disambiguation,
 GridLayout's algorithms favour rows and columns that are closer to its &lt;em&gt;right&lt;/em&gt;
 and &lt;em&gt;bottom&lt;/em&gt; edges. To be more precise, GridLayout treats each of its layout
 parameters as a constraint in the a set of variables that define the grid-lines along a
 given axis. During layout, GridLayout solves the constraints so as to return the unique
 solution to those constraints for which all variables are less-than-or-equal-to
 the corresponding value in any other valid solution.

 &lt;h4&gt;Interpretation of GONE&lt;/h4&gt;

 For layout purposes, GridLayout treats views whose visibility status is
 {@link View#GONE GONE}, as having zero width and height. This is subtly different from
 the policy of ignoring views that are marked as GONE outright. If, for example, a gone-marked
 view was alone in a column, that column would itself collapse to zero width if and only if
 no gravity was defined on the view. If gravity was defined, then the gone-marked
 view has no effect on the layout and the container should be laid out as if the view
 had never been added to it. GONE views are taken to have zero weight during excess space
 distribution.
 &lt;p&gt;
 These statements apply equally to rows as well as columns, and to groups of rows or columns.

 &lt;p&gt;
 See {@link android.widget.GridLayout.LayoutParams} for a full description of the
 layout parameters used by GridLayout.

 The order in which axes are laid out is important if, for example, the height of

 dependent on the widths of other components.

 orientation as {@code HORIZONTAL} - because {@code TextView} is capable of
 deriving its height for a given width, but not the other way around.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Other than the effects above, orientation does not affect the actual layout operation of
 GridLayout, so it's fine to leave GridLayout in {@code HORIZONTAL} mode even if
