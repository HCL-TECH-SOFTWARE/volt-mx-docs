 Iterates over processes, and all threads owned by those processes, and return the CPU usage for
 each thread. The CPU usage statistics contain the amount of time spent in a frequency band. CPU
 usage is collected using {@link com.android.internal.os.Uid.ProcTimeInStateReader}.

 &lt;p&gt;We only collect CPU data for processes and threads that are owned by certain UIDs. These UIDs
 are configured via {@link #setUidPredicate}.

 &lt;p&gt;Frequencies are bucketed together to reduce the amount of data created. This means that we
 return less frequencies than provided by {@link com.android.internal.os.Uid.ProcTimeInStateReader}. The number of frequencies
 is configurable by {@link #setNumBuckets}. Frequencies are reported as the lowest frequency in
 that range. Frequencies are spread as evenly as possible across the buckets. The buckets do not
 cross over the little/big frequencies reported.

 &lt;p&gt;N.B.: In order to bucket across little/big frequencies correctly, we assume that the {@code
 time_in_state} file contains every little core frequency in ascending order, followed by every
 big core frequency in ascending order. This assumption might not hold for devices with different
 kernel implementations of the {@code time_in_state} file generation.

 &lt;p&gt;This function will crawl through all process {@code proc} directories found by the pattern
 {@code /proc/[0-9]*}, and then check the UID using {@code /proc/$PID/status}. This takes
 approximately 500ms on a 2017 device. Therefore, this method can be computationally
 expensive, and should not be called more than once an hour.
