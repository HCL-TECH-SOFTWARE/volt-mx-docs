</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Reads human-readable cpu time proc files.

 It is implemented as singletons for built-in kernel proc files. Get___Instance() method will
 return corresponding reader instance. In order to prevent frequent GC, it reuses the same char[]
 to store data read from proc files.

 A KernelCpuProcStringReader instance keeps an error counter. When the number of read errors
 within that instance accumulates to 5, this instance will reject all further read requests.

 Data fetched within last 500ms is considered fresh, since the reading lifecycle can take up to
 100ms. KernelCpuProcStringReader always tries to use cache if it is fresh and valid, but it can
 be disabled through a parameter.

 A KernelCpuProcReader instance is thread-safe. It acquires a write lock when reading the proc
 file, releases it right after, then acquires a read lock before returning a ProcFileIterator.
 Caller is responsible for closing ProcFileIterator (also auto-closable) after reading, otherwise
 deadlock will occur.

 This method will tolerate at most 5 errors. After that, it will always return null. This is
 to save resources and to prevent log spam.

 This method is thread-safe. It first checks if there are other threads holding read/write
 lock. If there are, it assumes data is fresh and reuses the data.

 A read lock is automatically acquired when a valid ProcFileIterator is returned. Caller MUST
 call {@link com.android.internal.os.Uid.ProcFileIterator#close()} when it is done to release the lock.
@param {Boolean} ignoreCache If true, ignores the cache and refreshes the data anyway.
