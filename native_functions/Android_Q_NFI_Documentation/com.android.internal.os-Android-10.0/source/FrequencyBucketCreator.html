 Quantizes a list of N frequencies into a list of M frequencies (where M&lt;=N)

 &lt;p&gt;In order to reduce data sent from the device, we discard precise frequency information for
 an approximation. This is done by putting groups of adjacent frequencies into the same
 bucket, and then reporting that bucket under the minimum frequency in that bucket.

 &lt;p&gt;Many devices have multiple core clusters. We do not want to report frequencies from
 different clusters under the same bucket, so some complication arises.

 &lt;p&gt;Buckets are allocated evenly across all core clusters, i.e. they all have the same number
 of buckets regardless of how many frequencies they contain. This is done to reduce code
 complexity, and in practice the number of frequencies doesn't vary too much between core
 clusters.

 &lt;p&gt;If the number of buckets is not a factor of the number of frequencies, the remainder of
 the frequencies are placed into the last bucket.

 &lt;p&gt;It is possible to have less buckets than asked for, so any calling code can't assume that
 initializing with N buckets will use return N values. This happens in two scenarios:

 &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;There are less frequencies available than buckets asked for.
   &lt;li&gt;There are less frequencies in a core cluster than buckets allocated to that core
       cluster.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
