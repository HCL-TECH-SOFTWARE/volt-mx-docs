 Helper class for performing atomic operations on a directory, by creating a
 backup directory until a write has successfully completed.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Atomic directory guarantees directory integrity by ensuring that a directory has
 been completely written and sync'd to disk before removing its backup.
 As long as the backup directory exists, the original directory is considered
 to be invalid (leftover from a previous attempt to write).
 &lt;p&gt;
 Atomic directory does not confer any file locking semantics. Do not use this
 class when the directory may be accessed or modified concurrently
 by multiple threads or processes. The caller is responsible for ensuring
 appropriate mutual exclusion invariants whenever it accesses the directory.
 &lt;p&gt;
 To ensure atomicity you must always use this class to interact with the
 backing directory when checking existence, making changes, and deleting.
