 An installation that is being actively staged. For an install to succeed,
 all existing and new packages must have identical package names, version
 codes, and signing certificates.
 &lt;p&gt;
 A session may contain any number of split packages. If the application
 does not yet exist, this session must include a base package.
 &lt;p&gt;
 If an APK included in this session is already defined by the existing
 installation (for example, the same split name), the APK in this session
 will replace the existing APK.
 &lt;p&gt;
 In such a case that multiple packages need to be committed simultaneously,
 multiple sessions can be referenced by a single multi-package session.
 This session is created with no package name and calling
 {@link android.content.pm.PackageInstaller.SessionParams#setMultiPackage()}. The individual session IDs can be
 added with {@link #addChildSessionId}(int) and commit of the multi-package
 session will result in all child sessions being committed atomically.
