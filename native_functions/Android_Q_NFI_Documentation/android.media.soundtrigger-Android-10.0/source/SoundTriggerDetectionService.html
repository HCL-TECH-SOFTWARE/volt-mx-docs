</span>@extends android.app.Service

 A service that allows interaction with the actual sound trigger detection on the system.

 &lt;p&gt; Sound trigger detection refers to detectors that match generic sound patterns that are
 not voice-based. The voice-based recognition models should utilize the {@link android.service.voice.VoiceInteractionService} instead. Access to this class needs to be
 protected by the {@value android.Manifest.permission.BIND_SOUND_TRIGGER_DETECTION_SERVICE}
 permission granted only to the system.

 &lt;p&gt;This service has to be explicitly started by an app, the system does not scan for and start
 these services.

 &lt;p&gt;If an operation ({@link #onGenericRecognitionEvent}, {@link #onError},
 {@link #onRecognitionPaused}, {@link #onRecognitionResumed}) is triggered the service is
 considered as running in the foreground. Once the operation is processed the service should call
 {@link #operationFinished(UUID, int)}. If this does not happen in
 {@link android.media.soundtrigger.SoundTriggerManager#getDetectionServiceOperationsTimeout()} milliseconds
 {@link #onStopOperation(UUID, Bundle, int)} is called and the service is unbound.

 &lt;p&gt;The total amount of operations per day might be limited.
