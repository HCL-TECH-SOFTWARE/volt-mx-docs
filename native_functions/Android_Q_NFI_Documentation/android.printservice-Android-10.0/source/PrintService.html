</span>@extends android.app.Service

 &lt;p&gt;
 This is the base class for implementing print services. A print service knows
 how to discover and interact one or more printers via one or more protocols.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Printer discovery&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 A print service is responsible for discovering printers, adding discovered printers,
 removing added printers, and updating added printers. When the system is interested
 in printers managed by your service it will call {@link #onCreatePrinterDiscoverySession}() from which you must return a new {@link android.printservice.PrinterDiscoverySession} instance. The returned session encapsulates the interaction
 between the system and your service during printer discovery. For description of this
 interaction refer to the documentation for {@link android.printservice.PrinterDiscoverySession}.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 For every printer discovery session all printers have to be added since system does
 not retain printers across sessions. Hence, each printer known to this print service
 should be added only once during a discovery session. Only an already added printer
 can be removed or updated. Removed printers can be added again.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Print jobs&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 When a new print job targeted to a printer managed by this print service is is queued,
 i.e. ready for processing by the print service, you will receive a call to {@link #onPrintJobQueued}(PrintJob). The print service may handle the print job immediately
 or schedule that for an appropriate time in the future. The list of all active print
 jobs for this service is obtained by calling {@link #getActivePrintJobs}(). Active
 print jobs are ones that are queued or started.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 A print service is responsible for setting a print job's state as appropriate
 while processing it. Initially, a print job is queued, i.e. {@link android.printservice.PrintJob#isQueued()
 android.printservice.PrintJob.isQueued()} returns true, which means that the document to be printed is
 spooled by the system and the print service can begin processing it. You can obtain
 the printed document by calling {@link android.printservice.PrintJob#getDocument() android.printservice.PrintJob.getDocument()}
 whose data is accessed via {@link android.printservice.PrintDocument#getData() android.printservice.PrintDocument.getData()}.
 After the print service starts printing the data it should set the print job's
 state to started by calling {@link android.printservice.PrintJob#start()} after which
 {@link android.printservice.PrintJob#isStarted() android.printservice.PrintJob.isStarted()} would return true. Upon successful
 completion, the print job should be marked as completed by calling {@link android.printservice.PrintJob#complete() android.printservice.PrintJob.complete()} after which {@link android.printservice.PrintJob#isCompleted()
 android.printservice.PrintJob.isCompleted()} would return true. In case of a failure, the print job should
 be marked as failed by calling {@link android.printservice.PrintJob#fail(String) android.printservice.PrintJob.fail(
 String)} after which {@link android.printservice.PrintJob#isFailed() android.printservice.PrintJob.isFailed()} would
 return true.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 If a print job is queued or started and the user requests to cancel it, the print
 service will receive a call to {@link #onRequestCancelPrintJob}(PrintJob) which
 requests from the service to do best effort in canceling the job. In case the job
 is successfully canceled, its state has to be marked as cancelled by calling {@link android.printservice.PrintJob#cancel() android.printservice.PrintJob.cancel()} after which {@link android.printservice.PrintJob#isCancelled()
 android.printservice.PrintJob.isCacnelled()} would return true.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Lifecycle&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 The lifecycle of a print service is managed exclusively by the system and follows
 the established service lifecycle. Additionally, starting or stopping a print service
 is triggered exclusively by an explicit user action through enabling or disabling it
 in the device settings. After the system binds to a print service, it calls {@link #onConnected}(). This method can be overriden by clients to perform post binding setup.
 Also after the system unbinds from a print service, it calls {@link #onDisconnected}().
 This method can be overriden by clients to perform post unbinding cleanup. Your should
 not do any work after the system disconnected from your print service since the
 service can be killed at any time to reclaim memory. The system will not disconnect
 from a print service if there are active print jobs for the printers managed by it.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Declaration&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 A print service is declared as any other service in an AndroidManifest.xml but it must
 also specify that it handles the {@link android.content.Intent} with action {@link #SERVICE_INTERFACE android.printservice.PrintService}. Failure to declare this intent
 will cause the system to ignore the print service. Additionally, a print service must
 request the {@link android.Manifest.permission#BIND_PRINT_SERVICE
 android.permission.BIND_PRINT_SERVICE} permission to ensure that only the system can
 bind to it. Failure to declare this intent will cause the system to ignore the print
 service. Following is an example declaration:
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;pre&gt;
 &amp;lt;service android:name=&quot;.MyPrintService&quot;
         android:permission=&quot;android.permission.BIND_PRINT_SERVICE&quot;&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;intent-filter&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;action android:name=&quot;android.printservice.PrintService&quot; /&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;/intent-filter&amp;gt;
     . . .
 &amp;lt;/service&amp;gt;
 &lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Configuration&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 A print service can be configured by specifying an optional settings activity which
 exposes service specific settings, an optional add printers activity which is used for
 manual addition of printers, vendor name ,etc. It is a responsibility of the system
 to launch the settings and add printers activities when appropriate.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 A print service is configured by providing a {@link #SERVICE_META_DATA meta-data}
 entry in the manifest when declaring the service. A service declaration with a meta-data
 tag is presented below:
 &lt;pre&gt; &amp;lt;service android:name=&quot;.MyPrintService&quot;
         android:permission=&quot;android.permission.BIND_PRINT_SERVICE&quot;&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;intent-filter&amp;gt;
         &amp;lt;action android:name=&quot;android.printservice.PrintService&quot; /&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;/intent-filter&amp;gt;
     &amp;lt;meta-data android:name=&quot;android.printservice&quot; android:resource=&quot;@xml/printservice&quot; /&amp;gt;
 &amp;lt;/service&amp;gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 For more details for how to configure your print service via the meta-data refer to
 {@link #SERVICE_META_DATA} and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;{@link android.R.styleable#PrintService
 print-service}&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
 &lt;/p&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 &lt;strong&gt;Note: &lt;/strong&gt; All callbacks in this class are executed on the main
 application thread. You should also invoke any method of this class on the main
 application thread.
 &lt;/p&gt;
