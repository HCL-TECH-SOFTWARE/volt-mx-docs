 An implementation of a task aggregator that executes tasks in the order that they are expected
 . All tasks that is given to {@link #execute(Object, Runnable)} must correspond to a key. This
 key must have been previously declared with {@link #expect(Object, com.android.bitmap.ContiguousFIFOAggregator.Callback)}.
 The task will be scheduled to run when its corresponding key becomes the first expected key
 amongst the other keys in this aggregator.
 &lt;p/&gt;
 If on {@link #execute(Object, Runnable)} the key is not expected, the task will be executed
 immediately as an edge case.
 &lt;p/&gt;
 A characteristic scenario is as follows:
 &lt;ol&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Expect keys &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;, and &lt;b&gt;Z&lt;/b&gt;, in that order. Key &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; is now
 the first expected key.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Execute task &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; for key &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;. The first expected key is &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;,
 which has no task associated with it, so we store task &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Execute task &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt; for key &lt;b&gt;Z&lt;/b&gt;. We store task &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Execute task &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; for key &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt;. We run task &lt;b&gt;1&lt;/b&gt; because its key &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; is
 the first expected, then we remove key &lt;b&gt;A&lt;/b&gt; from the list of keys that we expect.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;This causes key &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt; to be the first expected key, and we see that we have previously
 stored task &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; for that key. We run task &lt;b&gt;2&lt;/b&gt; and remove key &lt;b&gt;B&lt;/b&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Key &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; is now the first expected key, but it has no task,
 so nothing happens. Task &lt;b&gt;4&lt;/b&gt;, which was previously stored,
 cannot run until its corresponding key &lt;b&gt;Z&lt;/b&gt; becomes the first expected key. This can
 happen if a task comes in for key &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt; or if forget is called on key &lt;b&gt;C&lt;/b&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ol&gt;
