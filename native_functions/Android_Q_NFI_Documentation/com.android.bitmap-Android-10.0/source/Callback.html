 We don't need a noLongerFirstExpected() method because this aggregator strictly adds
 additional to the end of the queue. For a first expected key to no longer be the first
 expected, it would either have to be forgotten with {@link #forget}(Object) or a task
 assigned and executed with {@link #execute(Object, Runnable)}.
@param {Object {Object}} key The key that became first. We provide the key so the callback can either not
            keep state, or it can keep state which may have changed so the callback can do
            a comparison.
