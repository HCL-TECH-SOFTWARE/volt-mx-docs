If it returns a value for the external subset, that root\n element is declared to be the root element, giving the effect of\n splicing a DOCTYPE declaration at the end the prolog of a document\n that could not otherwise be valid.  The sequence of parser callbacks\n in that case logically resembles this:</p></p>\n\n<pre> ... comments and PIs from the prolog (as usual)\n startDTD (\"rootName\", source.getPublicId (), source.getSystemId ());\n startEntity (\"[dtd]\");\n ... declarations, comments, and PIs from the external subset\n endEntity (\"[dtd]\");\n endDTD ();\n ... then the rest of the document (as usual)\n startElement (..., \"rootName\", ...);\n </pre>\n\n\n<p> <p>Note that the InputSource gets no further resolution.\n Implementations of this method may wish to invoke\n <a href=\"#!/api/org.xml.sax.ext.EntityResolver2-method-resolveEntity\" rel=\"org.xml.sax.ext.EntityResolver2-method-resolveEntity\" class=\"docClass\">resolveEntity()</a> to gain benefits such as use\n of local caches of DTD entities.
