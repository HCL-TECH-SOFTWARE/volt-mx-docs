</span> implements org.xml.sax.EntityResolver

 Extended interface for mapping external entity references to input
 sources, or providing a missing external subset.  The
 {@link XMLReader#setEntityResolver XMLReader.setEntityResolver()} method
 is used to provide implementations of this interface to parsers.
 When a parser uses the methods in this interface, the
 {@link org.xml.sax.ext.EntityResolver2#resolveEntity org.xml.sax.ext.EntityResolver2.resolveEntity()}
 method (in this interface) is used &lt;em&gt;instead of&lt;/em&gt; the older (SAX 1.0)
 {@link EntityResolver#resolveEntity EntityResolver.resolveEntity()} method.

 &lt;blockquote&gt;
 &lt;em&gt;This module, both source code and documentation, is in the
 Public Domain, and comes with &lt;strong&gt;NO WARRANTY&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;
 &lt;/blockquote&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If a SAX application requires the customized handling which this
 interface defines for external entities, it must ensure that it uses
 an XMLReader with the
 &lt;em&gt;http://xml.org/sax/features/use-entity-resolver2&lt;/em&gt; feature flag
 set to &lt;em&gt;true&lt;/em&gt; (which is its default value when the feature is
 recognized).  If that flag is unrecognized, or its value is false,
 or the resolver does not implement this interface, then only the
 {@link EntityResolver} method will be used.
 &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;That supports three categories of application that modify entity
 resolution.  &lt;em&gt;Old Style&lt;/em&gt; applications won't know about this interface;
 they will provide an EntityResolver.
 &lt;em&gt;Transitional Mode&lt;/em&gt; provide an EntityResolver2 and automatically
 get the benefit of its methods in any systems (parsers or other tools)
 supporting it, due to polymorphism.
 Both &lt;em&gt;Old Style&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Transitional Mode&lt;/em&gt; applications will
 work with any SAX2 parser.
 &lt;em&gt;New style&lt;/em&gt; applications will fail to run except on SAX2 parsers
 that support this particular feature.
 They will insist that feature flag have a value of &quot;true&quot;, and the
 EntityResolver2 implementation they provide  might throw an exception
 if the original SAX 1.0 style entity resolution method is invoked.
 &lt;/p&gt;

<span id='org-xml-sax-ext-EntityResolver2-method-getExternalSubset'>/**Allows applications to provide an external subset for documents
</span> that don't explicitly define one.  Documents with DOCTYPE declarations
 that omit an external subset can thus augment the declarations
 available for validation, entity processing, and attribute processing
 (normalization, defaulting, and reporting types including ID).
 This augmentation is reported
 through the {@link org.xml.sax.ext.LexicalHandler#startDTD startDTD()} method as if
 the document text had originally included the external subset;
 this callback is made before any internal subset data or errors
 are reported.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;This method can also be used with documents that have no DOCTYPE
 declaration.  When the root element is encountered,
 but no DOCTYPE declaration has been seen, this method is
 invoked.  If it returns a value for the external subset, that root
 element is declared to be the root element, giving the effect of
 splicing a DOCTYPE declaration at the end the prolog of a document
 that could not otherwise be valid.  The sequence of parser callbacks
 in that case logically resembles this:&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;pre&gt;
 ... comments and PIs from the prolog (as usual)
 startDTD (&quot;rootName&quot;, source.getPublicId (), source.getSystemId ());
 startEntity (&quot;[dtd]&quot;);
 ... declarations, comments, and PIs from the external subset
 endEntity (&quot;[dtd]&quot;);
 endDTD ();
 ... then the rest of the document (as usual)
 startElement (..., &quot;rootName&quot;, ...);
 &lt;/pre&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Note that the InputSource gets no further resolution.
 Implementations of this method may wish to invoke
 {@link #resolveEntity resolveEntity()} to gain benefits such as use
 of local caches of DTD entities.  Also, this method will never be
 used by a (non-validating) processor that is not including external
 parameter entities. &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Uses for this method include facilitating data validation when
 interoperating with XML processors that would always require
 undesirable network accesses for external entities, or which for
 other reasons adopt a &quot;no DTDs&quot; policy.
 Non-validation motives include forcing documents to include DTDs so
 that attributes are handled consistently.
 For example, an XPath processor needs to know which attibutes have
 type &quot;ID&quot; before it can process a widely used type of reference.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Warning:&lt;/strong&gt; Returning an external subset modifies
 the input document.  By providing definitions for general entities,
 it can make a malformed document appear to be well formed.
 &lt;/p&gt;
@param {String} name Identifies the document root element.  This name comes
    from a DOCTYPE declaration (where available) or from the actual
    root element.
@param {String} baseURI The document's base URI, serving as an additional
    hint for selecting the external subset.  This is always an absolute
    URI, unless it is null because the XMLReader was given an InputSource
    without one.
@return {Object {org.xml.sax.InputSource}} An InputSource object describing the new external subset
    to be used by the parser, or null to indicate that no external
    subset is provided.
@exception SAXException Any SAX exception, possibly wrapping
    another exception.
@exception IOException Probably indicating a failure to create
    a new InputStream or Reader, or an illegal URL.

<span id='org-xml-sax-ext-EntityResolver2-method-resolveEntity'>/**Allows applications to map references to external entities into input
</span> sources, or tell the parser it should use conventional URI resolution.
 This method is only called for external entities which have been
 properly declared.
 This method provides more flexibility than the {@link EntityResolver}
 interface, supporting implementations of more complex catalogue
 schemes such as the one defined by the &lt;a href=
    &quot;http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/entity/spec-2001-08-06.html&quot;
    &gt;OASIS XML Catalogs&lt;/a&gt; specification.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Parsers configured to use this resolver method will call it
 to determine the input source to use for any external entity
 being included because of a reference in the XML text.
 That excludes the document entity, and any external entity returned
 by {@link #getExternalSubset getExternalSubset()}.
 When a (non-validating) processor is configured not to include
 a class of entities (parameter or general) through use of feature
 flags, this method is not invoked for such entities.  &lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Note that the entity naming scheme used here is the same one
 used in the {@link org.xml.sax.ext.LexicalHandler}, or in the {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler#skippedEntity
    ContentHandler.skippedEntity()}
 method. &lt;/p&gt;
@param {String} name Identifies the external entity being resolved.
    Either &quot;[dtd]&quot; for the external subset, or a name starting
    with &quot;%&quot; to indicate a parameter entity, or else the name of
    a general entity.  This is never null when invoked by a SAX2
    parser.
@param {String} publicId The public identifier of the external entity being
    referenced (normalized as required by the XML specification), or
    null if none was supplied.
@param {String} baseURI The URI with respect to which relative systemIDs
    are interpreted.  This is always an absolute URI, unless it is
    null (likely because the XMLReader was given an InputSource without
  one).  This URI is defined by the XML specification to be the one
    associated with the &quot;&amp;lt;&quot; starting the relevant declaration.
@param {String} systemId The system identifier of the external entity
    being referenced; either a relative or absolute URI.
  This is never null when invoked by a SAX2 parser; only declared
    entities, and any external subset, are resolved by such parsers.
@return {Object {org.xml.sax.InputSource}} An InputSource object describing the new input source to
    be used by the parser.  Returning null directs the parser to
    resolve the system ID against the base URI and open a connection
    to resulting URI.
@exception SAXException Any SAX exception, possibly wrapping
    another exception.
@exception IOException Probably indicating a failure to create
    a new InputStream or Reader, or an illegal URL.
