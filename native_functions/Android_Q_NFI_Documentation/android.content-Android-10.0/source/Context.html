 These files are internal to the applications, and not typically visible
 to the user as media.
 &lt;p&gt;
 This is like {@link #getFilesDir}() in that these files will be deleted
 when the application is uninstalled, however there are some important
 differences:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt;Shared storage may not always be available, since removable media can
 be ejected by the user. Media state can be checked using
 {@link Environment#getExternalStorageState(File)}.
 &lt;li&gt;There is no security enforced with these files. For example, any
 application holding
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} can write to
 these files.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;
 If a shared storage device is emulated (as determined by
 {@link Environment#isExternalStorageEmulated(File)}), it's contents are
 backed by a private user data partition, which means there is little
 benefit to storing data here instead of the private directories returned
 by {@link #getFilesDir}(), etc.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Starting in {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#KITKAT}, no permissions
 are required to read or write to the returned path; it's always
 accessible to the calling app. This only applies to paths generated for
 package name of the calling application. To access paths belonging to
 other packages,
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} and/or
 {@link android.Manifest.permission#READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE} are required.
 &lt;p&gt;
 On devices with multiple users (as described by {@link UserManager}),
 each user has their own isolated shared storage. Applications only have
 access to the shared storage for the user they're running as.
 &lt;p&gt;
 The returned path may change over time if different shared storage media
 is inserted, so only relative paths should be persisted.
 &lt;p&gt;
 Here is an example of typical code to manipulate a file in an
 application's shared storage:
 &lt;/p&gt;

 If you supply a non-null &lt;var&gt;type&lt;/var&gt; to this function, the returned
 file will be a path to a sub-directory of the given type. Though these
 files are not automatically scanned by the media scanner, you can
 explicitly add them to the media database with
 {@link android.media.MediaScannerConnection#scanFile(Context, String[], String[], android.media.MediaScannerConnection.OnScanCompletedListener)
 MediaScannerConnection.scanFile}. Note that this is not the same as
 {@link android.os.Environment#getExternalStoragePublicDirectory
 Environment.getExternalStoragePublicDirectory()}, which provides
 directories of media shared by all applications. The directories returned

 a single call to {@link #stopService} will stop it.

<span id='android-content-Context-method-updateServiceGroup'>/**For a service previously bound with {@link #bindService} or a related method, change
</span> how the system manages that service's process in relation to other processes.  This
 doesn't modify the original bind flags that were passed in when binding, but adjusts
 how the process will be managed in some cases based on those flags.  Currently only
 works on isolated processes (will be ignored for non-isolated processes).

 &lt;p&gt;Note that this call does not take immediate effect, but will be applied the next
 time the impacted process is adjusted for some other reason.  Typically you would
 call this before then calling a new {@link #bindIsolatedService} on the service
 of interest, with that binding causing the process to be shuffled accordingly.&lt;/p&gt;
@param {Object {ServiceConnection}} conn The connection interface previously supplied to bindService().  This
             parameter must not be null.
@param {Number} group A group to put this connection's process in.  Upon calling here, this
              will override any previous group that was set for that process.  The group
              tells the system about processes that are logically grouped together, so
              should be managed as one unit of importance (such as when being considered
              a recently used app).  All processes in the same app with the same group
              are considered to be related.  Supplying 0 reverts to the default behavior
              of not grouping.
@param {Number} importance Additional importance of the processes within a group.  Upon calling
                   here, this will override any previous importance that was set for that
                   process.  The most important process is 0, and higher values are
                   successively less important.  You can view this as describing how
                   to order the processes in an array, with the processes at the end of
                   the array being the least important.  This value has no meaning besides
                   indicating how processes should be ordered in that array one after the
                   other.  This provides a way to fine-tune the system's process killing,
                   guiding it to kill processes at the end of the array first.
