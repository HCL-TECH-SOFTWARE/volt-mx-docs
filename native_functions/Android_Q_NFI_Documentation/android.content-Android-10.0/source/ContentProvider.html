</span> implements android.content.ContentInterface

 implements android.content.ComponentCallbacks2

@extends java.lang.Object

 Content providers are one of the primary building blocks of Android applications, providing
 content to applications. They encapsulate data and provide it to applications through the single
 {@link android.content.ContentResolver} interface. A content provider is only required if you need to share
 data between multiple applications. For example, the contacts data is used by multiple
 applications and must be stored in a content provider. If you don't need to share data amongst
 multiple applications you can use a database directly via
 {@link android.database.sqlite.SQLiteDatabase}.

 &lt;p&gt;When a request is made via
 a {@link android.content.ContentResolver} the system inspects the authority of the given URI and passes the
 request to the content provider registered with the authority. The content provider can interpret
 the rest of the URI however it wants. The {@link android.content.UriMatcher} class is helpful for parsing
 URIs.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;The primary methods that need to be implemented are:
 &lt;ul&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;{@link #onCreate} which is called to initialize the provider&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;{@link #query} which returns data to the caller&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;{@link #insert} which inserts new data into the content provider&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;{@link #update} which updates existing data in the content provider&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;{@link #delete} which deletes data from the content provider&lt;/li&gt;
   &lt;li&gt;{@link #getType} which returns the MIME type of data in the content provider&lt;/li&gt;
 &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p class=&quot;caution&quot;&gt;Data access methods (such as {@link #insert} and
 {@link #update}) may be called from many threads at once, and must be thread-safe.
 Other methods (such as {@link #onCreate}) are only called from the application
 main thread, and must avoid performing lengthy operations.  See the method
 descriptions for their expected thread behavior.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;Requests to {@link android.content.ContentResolver} are automatically forwarded to the appropriate
 ContentProvider instance, so subclasses don't have to worry about the details of
 cross-process calls.&lt;/p&gt;
