 Base class for code that receives and handles broadcast intents sent by
 {@link android.content.Context#sendBroadcast(Intent)}.

 &lt;p&gt;You can either dynamically register an instance of this class with
 {@link android.content.Context#registerReceiver android.content.Context.registerReceiver()}
 or statically declare an implementation with the
 {@link android.R.styleable#AndroidManifestReceiver &amp;lt;receiver&amp;gt;}
 tag in your &lt;code&gt;AndroidManifest.xml&lt;/code&gt;.

 &lt;div class=&quot;special reference&quot;&gt;
 &lt;h3&gt;Developer Guides&lt;/h3&gt;
 &lt;p&gt;For more information about using BroadcastReceiver, read the
 &lt;a href=&quot;{@docRoot}guide/components/broadcasts.html&quot;&gt;Broadcasts&lt;/a&gt; developer guide.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

var BroadcastReceiver = {

<span id='android-content-BroadcastReceiver-method-onReceive'>/**This method is called when the BroadcastReceiver is receiving an Intent
</span> broadcast.  During this time you can use the other methods on
 BroadcastReceiver to view/modify the current result values.  This method
 is always called within the main thread of its process, unless you
 explicitly asked for it to be scheduled on a different thread using
 {@link android.content.Context#registerReceiver(BroadcastReceiver,
 IntentFilter, String, android.os.Handler)}. When it runs on the main
 thread you should
 never perform long-running operations in it (there is a timeout of
 10 seconds that the system allows before considering the receiver to
 be blocked and a candidate to be killed). You cannot launch a popup dialog
 in your implementation of onReceive().

 &lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;If this BroadcastReceiver was launched through a &amp;lt;receiver&amp;gt; tag,
 then the object is no longer alive after returning from this
 function.&lt;/b&gt; This means you should not perform any operations that
 return a result to you asynchronously. If you need to perform any follow up
 background work, schedule a {@link android.app.job.JobService} with
 {@link android.app.job.JobScheduler}.

 If you wish to interact with a service that is already running and previously
 bound using {@link android.content.Context#bindService(Intent, ServiceConnection, int) bindService()},
 you can use {@link #peekService}.

 &lt;p&gt;The Intent filters used in {@link android.content.Context#registerReceiver}
 and in application manifests are &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; guaranteed to be exclusive. They
 are hints to the operating system about how to find suitable recipients. It is
 possible for senders to force delivery to specific recipients, bypassing filter
 resolution.  For this reason, {@link #onReceive(Context, android.content.Intent) onReceive()}
 implementations should respond only to known actions, ignoring any unexpected
 Intents that they may receive.
@param {Object {Context}} context The Context in which the receiver is running.
@param {Object {Intent}} intent The Intent being received.

<span id='android-content-BroadcastReceiver-method-goAsync'>/**This can be called by an application in {@link #onReceive} to allow
</span> it to keep the broadcast active after returning from that function.
 This does &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; change the expectation of being relatively
 responsive to the broadcast, but does allow
 the implementation to move work related to it over to another thread
 to avoid glitching the main UI thread due to disk IO.

 &lt;p&gt;As a general rule, broadcast receivers are allowed to run for up to 10 seconds
 before they system will consider them non-responsive and ANR the app.  Since these usually
 execute on the app's main thread, they are already bound by the ~5 second time limit
 of various operations that can happen there (not to mention just avoiding UI jank), so
 the receive limit is generally not of concern.  However, once you use {@code goAsync}, though
 able to be off the main thread, the broadcast execution limit still applies, and that
 includes the time spent between calling this method and ultimately
 {@link android.content.BroadcastReceiver.PendingResult#finish() android.content.BroadcastReceiver.PendingResult.finish()}.&lt;/p&gt;

 &lt;p&gt;If you are taking advantage of this method to have more time to execute, it is useful
 to know that the available time can be longer in certain situations.  In particular, if
 the broadcast you are receiving is not a foreground broadcast (that is, the sender has not
 used {@link android.content.Intent#FLAG_RECEIVER_FOREGROUND}), then more time is allowed for the receivers
 to run, allowing them to execute for 30 seconds or even a bit more.  This is something that
 receivers should rarely take advantage of (long work should be punted to another system
 facility such as {@link android.app.job.JobScheduler}, {@link android.app.Service}, or
 see especially {@link android.support.v4.app.JobIntentService}), but can be useful in
 certain rare cases where it is necessary to do some work as soon as the broadcast is
 delivered.  Keep in mind that the work you do here will block further broadcasts until
 it completes, so taking advantage of this at all excessively can be counter-productive
 and cause later events to be received more slowly.&lt;/p&gt;
@return {Object {android.content.BroadcastReceiver.PendingResult}} Returns a {@link PendingResult} representing the result of
 the active broadcast.  The BroadcastRecord itself is no longer active;
 all data and other interaction must go through {@link PendingResult}
 APIs.  The {@link PendingResult#finish PendingResult.finish()} method
 must be called once processing of the broadcast is done.
