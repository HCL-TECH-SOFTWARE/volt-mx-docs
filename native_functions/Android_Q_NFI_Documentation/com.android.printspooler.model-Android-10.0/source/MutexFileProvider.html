 This class provides a shared file to several threads. Only one thread
 at a time can use the file. To acquire the file a thread has to
 request it in a blocking call to {@link #acquireFile}(OnReleaseRequestCallback).
 The provided callback is optional and is used to notify the owning thread
 when another one wants to acquire the file. In case a release is requested
 the thread owning the file must release it as soon as possible. If no
 callback is provided a thread that acquires the file must release it
 as soon as possible, i.e. even if callback was provided the thread cannot
 have the file for less time.
