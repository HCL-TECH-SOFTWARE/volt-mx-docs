</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 Factory methods for file systems. This class defines the {@link #getDefault
 getDefault} method to get the default file system and factory methods to
 construct other types of file systems.

 &lt;p&gt; The first invocation of any of the methods defined by this class causes
 the default {@link java.nio.file.FileSystemProvider provider} to be loaded. The default
 provider, identified by the URI scheme &quot;file&quot;, creates the {@link java.nio.file.FileSystem}
 that provides access to the file systems accessible to the Java virtual
 machine. If the process of loading or initializing the default provider fails
 then an unspecified error is thrown.

 &lt;p&gt; The first invocation of the {@link java.nio.file.FileSystemProvider#installedProviders
 installedProviders} method, by way of invoking any of the {@code
 newFileSystem} methods defined by this class, locates and loads all
 installed file system providers. Installed providers are loaded using the
 service-provider loading facility defined by the {@link ServiceLoader} class.
 Installed providers are loaded using the system class loader. If the
 system class loader cannot be found then the extension class loader is used;
 if there is no extension class loader then the bootstrap class loader is used.
 Providers are typically installed by placing them in a JAR file on the
 application class path or in the extension directory, the JAR file contains a
 provider-configuration file named {@code java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider}
 in the resource directory {@code META-INF/services}, and the file lists one or
 more fully-qualified names of concrete subclass of {@link java.nio.file.FileSystemProvider}
 that have a zero argument constructor.
 The ordering that installed providers are located is implementation specific.
 If a provider is instantiated and its {@link java.nio.file.FileSystemProvider#getScheme()
 getScheme} returns the same URI scheme of a provider that was previously
 instantiated then the most recently instantiated duplicate is discarded. URI
 schemes are compared without regard to case. During construction a provider
 may safely access files associated with the default provider but care needs
 to be taken to avoid circular loading of other installed providers. If
 circular loading of installed providers is detected then an unspecified error
 is thrown.

 &lt;p&gt; This class also defines factory methods that allow a {@link ClassLoader}
 to be specified when locating a provider. As with installed providers, the
 provider classes are identified by placing the provider configuration file
 in the resource directory {@code META-INF/services}.

 &lt;p&gt; If a thread initiates the loading of the installed file system providers
 and another thread invokes a method that also attempts to load the providers
 then the method will block until the loading completes.

<span id='java-nio-file-FileSystems-method-getDefault'>/**Returns the default {@code FileSystem}. The default file system creates
</span> objects that provide access to the file systems accessible to the Java
 virtual machine. The &lt;em&gt;working directory&lt;/em&gt; of the file system is
 the current user directory, named by the system property {@code user.dir}.
 This allows for interoperability with the {@link java.io.File java.io.File}
 class.

 &lt;p&gt; The first invocation of any of the methods defined by this class
 locates the default {@link java.nio.file.FileSystemProvider provider} object. Where the
 system property {@code java.nio.file.spi.DefaultFileSystemProvider} is
 not defined then the default provider is a system-default provider that
 is invoked to create the default file system.

 &lt;p&gt; If the system property {@code java.nio.file.spi.DefaultFileSystemProvider}
 is defined then it is taken to be a list of one or more fully-qualified
 names of concrete provider classes identified by the URI scheme
 {@code &quot;file&quot;}. Where the property is a list of more than one name then
 the names are separated by a comma. Each class is loaded, using the system
 class loader, and instantiated by invoking a one argument constructor
 whose formal parameter type is {@code FileSystemProvider}. The providers
 are loaded and instantiated in the order they are listed in the property.
 If this process fails or a provider's scheme is not equal to {@code &quot;file&quot;}
 then an unspecified error is thrown. URI schemes are normally compared
 without regard to case but for the default provider, the scheme is
 required to be {@code &quot;file&quot;}. The first provider class is instantiated
 by invoking it with a reference to the system-default provider.
 The second provider class is instantiated by invoking it with a reference
 to the first provider instance. The third provider class is instantiated
 by invoking it with a reference to the second instance, and so on. The
 last provider to be instantiated becomes the default provider; its {@code
 getFileSystem} method is invoked with the URI {@code &quot;file:///&quot;} to
 get a reference to the default file system.

 &lt;p&gt; Subsequent invocations of this method return the file system that was
 returned by the first invocation.

</span>
 &lt;p&gt; This method iterates over the {@link java.nio.file.FileSystemProvider#installedProviders()
 installed} providers to locate the provider that is identified by the URI
 {@link URI#getScheme scheme} of the given URI. URI schemes are compared
 without regard to case. The exact form of the URI is highly provider
 dependent. If found, the provider's {@link java.nio.file.FileSystemProvider#getjava.nio.file.FileSystem
 getjava.nio.file.FileSystem} method is invoked to obtain a reference to the {@code
 FileSystem}.

 &lt;p&gt; Once a file system created by this provider is {@link java.nio.file.FileSystem#close
 closed} it is provider-dependent if this method returns a reference to
 the closed file system or throws {@link java.nio.file.FileSystemNotFoundException}.
 If the provider allows a new file system to be created with the same URI
 as a file system it previously created then this method throws the
 exception if invoked after the file system is closed (and before a new
 instance is created by the {@link #newFileSystem newFileSystem} method).

 &lt;p&gt; If a security manager is installed then a provider implementation
 may require to check a permission before returning a reference to an
 existing file system. In the case of the {@link java.nio.file.FileSystems#getDefault
 default} file system, no permission check is required.

 {@link URI#getScheme scheme} of the given URI. URI schemes are compared
