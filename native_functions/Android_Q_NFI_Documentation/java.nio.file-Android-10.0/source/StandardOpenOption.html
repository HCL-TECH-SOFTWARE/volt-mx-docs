 This option is primarily intended for use with &lt;em&gt;work files&lt;/em&gt; that
 are used solely by a single instance of the Java virtual machine. This
 option is not recommended for use when opening files that are open
 concurrently by other entities. Many of the details as to when and how
 the file is deleted are implementation specific and therefore not
 specified. In particular, an implementation may be unable to guarantee
 that it deletes the expected file when replaced by an attacker while the
 file is open. Consequently, security sensitive applications should take
 care when using this option.

 &lt;p&gt; For security reasons, this option may imply the {@link java.nio.file.LinkOption#NOFOLLOW_LINKS} option. In other words, if the option is present
 when opening an existing file that is a symbolic link then it may fail
 (by throwing {@link java.io.IOException}).
