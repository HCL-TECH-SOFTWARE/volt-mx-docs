</span> implements java.nio.file.DirectoryStream

 A {@code DirectoryStream} that defines operations on files that are located
 relative to an open directory. A {@code SecureDirectoryStream} is intended
 for use by sophisticated or security sensitive applications requiring to
 traverse file trees or otherwise operate on directories in a race-free manner.
 Race conditions can arise when a sequence of file operations cannot be
 carried out in isolation. Each of the file operations defined by this
 interface specify a relative path. All access to the file is relative
 to the open directory irrespective of if the directory is moved or replaced
 by an attacker while the directory is open. A {@code SecureDirectoryStream}
 may also be used as a virtual &lt;em&gt;working directory&lt;/em&gt;.

 &lt;p&gt; A {@code SecureDirectoryStream} requires corresponding support from the
 underlying operating system. Where an implementation supports this features
 then the {@code DirectoryStream} returned by the {@link java.nio.file.Files#newDirectoryStream
 newDirectoryStream} method will be a {@code SecureDirectoryStream} and must
 be cast to that type in order to invoke the methods defined by this interface.

 &lt;p&gt; In the case of the default {@link java.nio.file.spi.FileSystemProvider
 provider}, and a security manager is set, then the permission checks are
 performed using the path obtained by resolving the given relative path
 against the &lt;i&gt;original path&lt;/i&gt; of the directory (irrespective of if the
 directory is moved since it was opened).
