 Keeps track of link configuration received from Netlink.

 Instances of this class are expected to be owned by subsystems such as Wi-Fi
 or Ethernet that manage one or more network interfaces. Each interface to be
 tracked needs its own {@code NetlinkTracker}.

 An instance of this class is constructed by passing in an interface name and
 a callback. The owner is then responsible for registering the tracker with
 NetworkManagementService. When the class receives update notifications from
 the NetworkManagementService notification threads, it applies the update to
 its local LinkProperties, and if something has changed, notifies its owner of
 the update via the callback.

 The owner can then call {@code getLinkProperties()} in order to find out
 what changed. If in the meantime the LinkProperties stored here have changed,
 this class will return the current LinkProperties. Because each change
 triggers an update callback after the change is made, the owner may get more
 callbacks than strictly necessary (some of which may be no-ops), but will not
 be out of sync once all callbacks have been processed.

 Threading model:

 - The owner of this class is expected to create it, register it, and call
   getLinkProperties or clearLinkProperties on its thread.
 - Most of the methods in the class are inherited from BaseNetworkObserver
   and are called by NetworkManagementService notification threads.
 - All accesses to mLinkProperties must be synchronized(this). All the other
   member variables are immutable once the object is constructed.

 This class currently tracks IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. In the future it will
 track routes and DNS servers.
