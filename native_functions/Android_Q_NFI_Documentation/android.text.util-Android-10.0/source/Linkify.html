  Linkify take a piece of text and a regular expression and turns all of the
  regex matches in the text into clickable links.  This is particularly
  useful for matching things like email addresses, web URLs, etc. and making
  them actionable.

  Alone with the pattern that is to be matched, a URL scheme prefix is also
  required.  Any pattern match that does not begin with the supplied scheme
  will have the scheme prepended to the matched text when the clickable URL
  is created.  For instance, if you are matching web URLs you would supply
  the scheme &lt;code&gt;http://&lt;/code&gt;. If the pattern matches example.com, which
  does not have a URL scheme prefix, the supplied scheme will be prepended to
  create &lt;code&gt;http://example.com&lt;/code&gt; when the clickable URL link is
  created.

  &lt;p class=&quot;note&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Note:&lt;/b&gt; When using {@link #MAP_ADDRESSES} or {@link #ALL}
  to match street addresses on API level {@link android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES#O_MR1}
  and earlier, methods in this class may throw
  {@link android.util.AndroidRuntimeException} or other exceptions if the
  device's WebView implementation is currently being updated, because
  {@link android.webkit.WebView#findAddress} is required to match street
  addresses.
