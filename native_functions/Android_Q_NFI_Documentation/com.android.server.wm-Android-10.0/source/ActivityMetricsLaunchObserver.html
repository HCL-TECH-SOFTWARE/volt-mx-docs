</span> Observe activity manager launch sequences.

 The activity manager can have at most 1 concurrent launch sequences. Calls to this interface
 are ordered by a happens-before relation for each defined state transition (see below).

 When a new launch sequence is made, that sequence is in the {@code INTENT_STARTED} state which
 is communicated by the {@link #onIntentStarted} callback. This is a transient state.

 The intent can fail to launch the activity, in which case the sequence's state transitions to
 {@code INTENT_FAILED} via {@link #onIntentFailed}. This is a terminal state.

 If an activity is successfully started, the launch sequence's state will transition into
 {@code STARTED} via {@link #onActivityLaunched}. This is a transient state.

 It must then transition to either {@code CANCELLED} with {@link #onActivityLaunchCancelled}
 or into {@code FINISHED} with {@link #onActivityLaunchFinished}. These are terminal states.

 Note that the {@code ActivityRecordProto} provided as a parameter to some state transitions isn't
 necessarily the same within a single launch sequence: it is only the top-most activity at the
 time (if any). Trampoline activities coalesce several activity starts into a single launch
 sequence.

 Upon reaching a terminal state, it is considered that there are no active launch sequences
 until a subsequent transition into {@code INTENT_STARTED} initiates a new launch sequence.

</span>
 This is an intermediate state: once an activity begins starting, the entire launch sequence
 will later terminate by either finishing or cancelling.

 The initial activity is the first activity to be started as part of a launch sequence:
 it is represented by {@param activity} However, it isn't
 necessarily the activity which will be considered as displayed when the activity
 finishes launching (e.g. {@code activity} in {@link #onActivityLaunchFinished}).

 This function call terminates the current launch sequence. The next method call, if any,

 This can happen for many reasons, for example the user switches away to another app
