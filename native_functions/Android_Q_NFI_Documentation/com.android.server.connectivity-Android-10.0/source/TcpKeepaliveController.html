 Manage tcp socket which offloads tcp keepalive.

 The input socket will be changed to repair mode and the application
 will not have permission to read/write data. If the application wants
 to write data, it must stop tcp keepalive offload to leave repair mode
 first. If a remote packet arrives, repair mode will be turned off and
 offload will be stopped. The application will receive a callback to know
 it can start reading data.

 {start,stop}SocketMonitor are thread-safe, but care must be taken in the
 order in which they are called. Please note that while calling
 {@link #startSocketMonitor(FileDescriptor, Messenger, int)} multiple times
 with either the same slot or the same FileDescriptor without stopping it in
 between will result in an exception, calling {@link #stopSocketMonitor}(int)
 multiple times with the same int is explicitly a no-op.
 Please also note that switching the socket to repair mode is not synchronized
 with either of these operations and has to be done in an orderly fashion
 with stopSocketMonitor. Take care in calling these in the right order.
