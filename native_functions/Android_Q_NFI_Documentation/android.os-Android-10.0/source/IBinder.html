</span> Base interface for a remotable object, the core part of a lightweight
 remote procedure call mechanism designed for high performance when
 performing in-process and cross-process calls.  This
 interface describes the abstract protocol for interacting with a
 remotable object.  Do not implement this interface directly, instead
 extend from {@link android.os.Binder}.
 
 &lt;p&gt;The key IBinder API is {@link #transact transact()} matched by
 {@link android.os.Binder#onTransact android.os.Binder.onTransact()}.  These
 methods allow you to send a call to an IBinder object and receive a
 call coming in to a Binder object, respectively.  This transaction API
 is synchronous, such that a call to {@link #transact transact()} does not
 return until the target has returned from
 {@link android.os.Binder#onTransact android.os.Binder.onTransact()}; this is the
 expected behavior when calling an object that exists in the local
 process, and the underlying inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism
 ensures that these same semantics apply when going across processes.
 
 &lt;p&gt;The data sent through transact() is a {@link android.os.Parcel}, a generic buffer
 of data that also maintains some meta-data about its contents.  The meta
 data is used to manage IBinder object references in the buffer, so that those
 references can be maintained as the buffer moves across processes.  This
 mechanism ensures that when an IBinder is written into a Parcel and sent to
 another process, if that other process sends a reference to that same IBinder
 back to the original process, then the original process will receive the
 same IBinder object back.  These semantics allow IBinder/Binder objects to
 be used as a unique identity (to serve as a token or for other purposes)
 that can be managed across processes.
 
 &lt;p&gt;The system maintains a pool of transaction threads in each process that
 it runs in.  These threads are used to dispatch all
 IPCs coming in from other processes.  For example, when an IPC is made from
 process A to process B, the calling thread in A blocks in transact() as
 it sends the transaction to process B.  The next available pool thread in
 B receives the incoming transaction, calls Binder.onTransact() on the target
 object, and replies with the result Parcel.  Upon receiving its result, the
 thread in process A returns to allow its execution to continue.  In effect,
 other processes appear to use as additional threads that you did not create
 executing in your own process.
 
 &lt;p&gt;The Binder system also supports recursion across processes.  For example
 if process A performs a transaction to process B, and process B while
 handling that transaction calls transact() on an IBinder that is implemented
 in A, then the thread in A that is currently waiting for the original
 transaction to finish will take care of calling Binder.onTransact() on the
 object being called by B.  This ensures that the recursion semantics when
 calling remote binder object are the same as when calling local objects.
 
 &lt;p&gt;When working with remote objects, you often want to find out when they
 are no longer valid.  There are three ways this can be determined:
 &lt;ul&gt;
 &lt;li&gt; The {@link #transact transact()} method will throw a
 {@link android.os.RemoteException} exception if you try to call it on an IBinder
 whose process no longer exists.
 &lt;li&gt; The {@link #pingBinder}() method can be called, and will return false
 if the remote process no longer exists.
 &lt;li&gt; The {@link #linkToDeath linkToDeath()} method can be used to register
 a {@link android.os.IBinder.DeathRecipient} with the IBinder, which will be called when its
 containing process goes away.
 &lt;/ul&gt;
