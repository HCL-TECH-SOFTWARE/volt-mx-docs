 Waveform vibrations are a potentially repeating series of timing and amplitude pairs. For
 each pair, the value in the amplitude array determines the strength of the vibration and the

 vibration (i.e. off), and any pairs with a timing value of 0 will be ignored.

 The amplitude array of the generated waveform will be the same size as the given
 timing array with alternating values of 0 (i.e. off) and {@link #DEFAULT_AMPLITUDE},

 the vibrator on, the second value will be how long to vibrate at {@link #DEFAULT_AMPLITUDE}
 strength, etc.

 To cause the pattern to repeat, pass the index into the timings array at which to start the
