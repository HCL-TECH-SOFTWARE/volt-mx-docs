</span>@extends java.lang.Object

 A Handler allows you to send and process {@link android.os.Message} and Runnable
 objects associated with a thread's {@link android.os.MessageQueue}.  Each Handler
 instance is associated with a single thread and that thread's message
 queue.  When you create a new Handler, it is bound to the thread /
 message queue of the thread that is creating it -- from that point on,
 it will deliver messages and runnables to that message queue and execute
 them as they come out of the message queue.
 
 &lt;p&gt;There are two main uses for a Handler: (1) to schedule messages and
 runnables to be executed at some point in the future; and (2) to enqueue
 an action to be performed on a different thread than your own.
 
 &lt;p&gt;Scheduling messages is accomplished with the
 {@link #post}, {@link #postAtTime(Runnable, long)},
 {@link #postDelayed}, {@link #sendEmptyMessage},
 {@link #sendMessage}, {@link #sendMessageAtTime}, and
 {@link #sendMessageDelayed} methods.  The &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt; versions allow
 you to enqueue Runnable objects to be called by the message queue when
 they are received; the &lt;em&gt;sendMessage&lt;/em&gt; versions allow you to enqueue
 a {@link android.os.Message} object containing a bundle of data that will be
 processed by the Handler's {@link #handleMessage} method (requiring that
 you implement a subclass of Handler).
 
 &lt;p&gt;When posting or sending to a Handler, you can either
 allow the item to be processed as soon as the message queue is ready
 to do so, or specify a delay before it gets processed or absolute time for
 it to be processed.  The latter two allow you to implement timeouts,
 ticks, and other timing-based behavior.
 
 &lt;p&gt;When a
 process is created for your application, its main thread is dedicated to
 running a message queue that takes care of managing the top-level
 application objects (activities, broadcast receivers, etc) and any windows
 they create.  You can create your own threads, and communicate back with
 the main application thread through a Handler.  This is done by calling
 the same &lt;em&gt;post&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;sendMessage&lt;/em&gt; methods as before, but from
 your new thread.  The given Runnable or Message will then be scheduled
 in the Handler's message queue and processed when appropriate.

 This method is dangerous!  Improper use can result in deadlocks.
 Never call this method while any locks are held or use it in a
 possibly re-entrant manner.
 &lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;
 This method is occasionally useful in situations where a background thread
 must synchronously await completion of a task that must run on the
 handler's thread.  However, this problem is often a symptom of bad design.
 Consider improving the design (if possible) before resorting to this method.

 set up a Handler thread and need to perform some initialization steps on
 it before continuing execution.
