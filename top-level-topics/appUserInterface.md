### [Using Widgets](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/PopulatingWidgets.html)
Learn about the use of widgets (the building blocks of a screen) in a digital app and understand the specific purpose of each widget, such as user interaction or animation. Volt MX Iris provides you with built-in widgets that help you build your required functionality. You can configure every widget based on your needs.

### [Responsive Design for Web](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Responsive_Design_8_2.html)
