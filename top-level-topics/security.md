### [Application Security](Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/ApplicationSecurity.html)
Learn about security methods such as design time security, critical business logic security, and on-device encryption. Volt MX leverages these methods to protect the applications.

### [Public Key Pinning](Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Public_Key_Pinning.html)
Use the Public Key Pinning security feature to associate a host with their expected X509 certificate or a public key. Once a host's certificate or public key is known or identified, the certificate or public key is associated or 'pinned' to the host. This offers protection against certificate forgery.

### [SSL Validation for WKWebView Browser](Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/Browser_Properties.html)
