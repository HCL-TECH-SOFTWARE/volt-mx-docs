=======

Volt MX  Foundry captures a set of standard metrics and provides a set of APIs for capturing custom metrics and events. This data is processed and stored in a relational data model that can be analyzed by any business intelligence (BI) or reporting engine. Volt MX provides a set of standard reports for TIBCO Software’s Jaspersoft BI server that can help you analyze and report on this data, and even design your own custom reports. The results of these reports can be viewed in various chart types or exported to PDF, Excel, or a comma separated value (CSV) file.
