# Get Geolocation by ID

The **Get Geolocation by ID** API uses the geolocation ID as an input parameter and returns the location details.

## Use Case

The user would like to get the details of a geoboundary that is associated with an ATM location. The user already retrieved the geolocation IDs in his/her application. Because the geolocation ID uniquely identifies a geolocation in the engagement server, the user can then invoke this API to retrieve the details.

## URL

The HTTP URL for **Get Geolocation by ID** API is:

```
http://<host>:<port>/api/v1/geolocations/{id}
```

This API is protected and implements Gateway Filter for Authentication to authenticate access of the API by a user.

> **_Note:_** <id>: Here, id refers to an id that is used to map a geolocation with internal data record.

## Method

GET

## Input Parameters

The following fields are input parameters:

| Input Parameter | Required | Type | Description                                                                                |
| --------------- | -------- | ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| id              | Yes      | long | The id is used to map a geolocation with an internal data record in the engagement server. |

## Output Parameters

| clientAction        | string | Possible values are: "Notify Engagement Server" - This is the default value. This means that the client application will need to update its location with the Engagement server when the geoboundary is entered. This could be used in a scenario where the Engagement server will need to send the notifications because of a location-based campaign that is set up. "Local Notification"- This value means that the client application must display a local notification when the geoboundary is entered. All the geoboundaries with this clientAction have a local notification message that is associated and this is the message that is displayed in the local notification. "Custom Client Logic" - This value is any java script code that needs to be executed by the client application. A geoboundary with this clientAction will have a java script code that is associated with it which can be executed on the client side if needed. |
