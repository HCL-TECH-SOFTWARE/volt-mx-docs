Similarly, there are other common extensions that are mapped by default. > **_Note:_** If the response header is not defined, the server displays an empty string leaving it to the browser to sniff the mime types placed in Volt MX Foundry to intercept and alter the mime types of the requested resource. |
| Cache Control Age (in secs) | The Cache-Control header in the response i.e. the maximum cache duration in seconds. The default value is 86400 seconds (i.e. 1 day). |
| HTTP Session Caching | Enable this to cache the user session data. The value is set to True, by default. |
| Custom Response Headers | You can use the property to return additional custom headers in every response. For every requested resource of SPA application, the mentioned headers are added to the response. You can add the response header and its value to the field. It takes an array of JSON objects. Each JSON object contains two keys name and value. Name is the **header name** and value as the **header value**. Example: \[ {'name': 'X-Content-Type-Options', 'value': 'nosniff'} \] **Limitations**: The header key and the value are static. The header and the value added are not specific for SPA application (or) resources (global). > **_Note:_** User is responsible to provide a valid header key and value.The default value of the field is blank. |
| Enable iPad Redirect | Enable this to redirect requests coming from iPad devices above iOS 13 to iPad view instead of Desktop view. By default, it is False. |

### Cache Configuration

Volt MX  Foundry supports EHCache, Memcached, and Redis cache vendors. An On-premise setup of Volt MX Foundry uses EHCache as the default cache mechanism. A cloud environment uses Memcached as the default cache mechanism. The **Cache Configuration** section displays the configuration properties of the new cache mechanism. The section displays the properties such as Cache Type, Expiry time, Cache Server URLs, Advanced Cache properties, and Enable Session Distribution. You can modify any setting and click **Save** to update the change.

The following table describes the settings in the **Cache Configuration** section:

  
| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Cache Type | The type of cache to use. The list displays the following possible options - **EHCACHE**, **MEMECACHED**, and **REDIS**. |
| Cache Expiry | The cache expiry time in seconds for each cache entry. The default value is 20 minutes. > **_Note:_** The default cache expiry time is 20 minutes. |
| Cache Server URLs | The URLs of the external cache servers. For example, MEMCACHED - **For single node** - `<IP address/hostname>:<port>`. **For Multi-node** - `<IP address1/hostname1>:<port1>, <IP address2/hostname2>:<port2>` REDIS **For single node** - `<IP address/hostname>:<port>`. For a Cluster Redis setup, provide the list of master nodes (separated by commas) in multimode memcached nodes.`<IP address1/hostname1>:<port1>,<IPaddress2/hostname2>:<port2>`. |
| Advanced Properties | The advanced properties, specific to cache type, in JSON format. **Default JSON template property**: `{"environment_properties":{},"jcache_configuration_properties":_{}, "additional_properties":_{}}` **environment\_properties**: Add the cache properties that are utilized by Volt MX Foundry. For example, to identify the mode of the Redis server, you must add the following property. The `REDIS_CACHE_MODE` property will have the value as "SINGLE", "CLUSTER" or "SENTINAL" based on the Redis server mode. **Advanced properties of REDIS cluster mode**: `{"environment_properties":{"REDIS_CACHE_MODE":"CLUSTER"},"jcache_configuration_properties":{},"additional_properties":_{}}` > **_Note:_** If `REDIS_CACHE_MODE` is not defined in **Advanced Properties**, Volt MX Foundry considers REDIS as the single node setup. **jcache\_configurations\_properties**: Custom properties related to JCache configuration are configured in this section. The configured custom properties are sent directly to JCache. **additional\_properties**: The properties that are not related to REDIS or JCache configuration must be added in this section. |
| Enable Session Distribution | Enable the property to distribute the cache session among multiple nodes. > **_Note:_** EHCache does not support session distribution. If you want to distribute the session data among the multiple nodes, the cache type must be MEMCACHE or REDIS. |

### Global Throttling Configuration

Apart from configuring the service level throttling from the Volt MX Foundry console, you can also configure the operation level throttling from the Global Throttling Configuration field. The throttling limit set for a service is applicable to all the operations within the service, whereas, the throttling information given here will be implied to the respective operation of the service that you mention here.

> **_Note:_** If you have set the throttling limit at both service and operation level, then the service will not respond when either of the limit is met first.

The following table describes the settings in the **Global Throttling Configuration** section:

  
| Property | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Operation Level Throttling | You can limit the number of times the operation is invoked per minute. You can provide the throttling information in a JSON array format > **_Note:_** If an API exceeds the throttling limit, it will not return the service response. |

Following are the parameters required to define the throttling limit for the respective service type:

**Integration and Orchestration Service:**

```
[ 
   { 
      "resourcePath":"NameService/getFirstName",
      "httpMethod":"POST",
      "totalRateLimitPerMinute":100,
      "ipRateLimitPerMinute":10
   },
   { 
      "resourcePath":"NameService/getLastName",
      "httpMethod":"POST",
      "totalRateLimitPerMinute":110,
      "ipRateLimitPerMinute":11
   }  
]
```

**Object Service:**

```
[ 
   { 
      "resourcePath":"ObjectServiceName/Object",
      "httpMethod":"GET",
      "totalRateLimitPerMinute":100,
      "ipRateLimitPerMinute":10
   },
   { 
      "resourcePath":"ObjectServiceName/Object",
      "httpMethod":"GET",
      "totalRateLimitPerMinute":100,
      "ipRateLimitPerMinute":10
   }
]
```

> **_Important:_** You can only configure the POST _httpMethod_ for Integration service and Orchestration service types. For Object service, you can configure GET and DELETE _httpMethod_ as is, whereas, the POST and PUT _httpMethod_ should be configured as CREATE and UPDATE respectively.

> **_Note:_** If you want to apply throttling on some custom verb, then you can configure the custom verb as the _httpMethod_.

> **_Note:_** \*\* displayed beside the property implies the changes to the property groups required restart of the server to reflect modified values.
