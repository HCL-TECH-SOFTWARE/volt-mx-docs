To configure secured communication between the server and the client, App Services provides an interface to upload the cliennt certificates and the root certificates of the backend to the middleware. The uploaded SSL certificates aids in encrypting the information sent between the client and the server.

There are two ways of uploading the certificates to the middleware:

*   One-way SSL
*   Two-way SSL

**One-way SSL**: A root certificate of the backend server is uploaded . When the client sends a request to the server, the middleware server(client) validates the certificate uploaded with the certificate in the trust store. If the certificate is found in the trust store, the client accepts the communication from the server.

**Two-way SSL**: A client SSL certificate is uploaded in the key store. When a request is received , both the parties (client and the server) validates the certificates uploaded and the response is sent to the client.

**To access SSL certificates in the App Services, follow these steps:**

1.  Log on to **App Services**. For more information on logging, refer [Launching the App Services](Launching_Admin_Console.md).
2.  Click **Settings** from the left pane of the App Services and click **SSL Certificates** tab to upload the SSL certificates. The **SSL Certificates** page appears.
