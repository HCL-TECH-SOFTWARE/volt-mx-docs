| Column | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Service Name | The name of the service created |
| Service Type | The type of the service created. For more information on different types of services, refer [VoltMX Foundry Supported Endpoints](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/ObjectsServices/Objectservices_Stage1.md). |
| Versions | The version number selected while creating the service. For more information on versioning, refer [API Versioning](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/API_Versioning.md). |
| App Data Model Objects | The list of predefined objects configured in Volt MX Foundry Console. You can test a service by selecting an object from the drop-down list. |

If any Storage service is unpublished in Volt MX Foundry, its status changes to Storage (Unused) in Services Type and a **Delete** icon appears for that service. Click the **Delete** icon if you want to remove the data associated with that storage service permanently and free up the space in the environment.

> **_Note:_** You can export the data associated to the storage service before deleting it.

Hard Delete option for Storage Services using the X-VoltMX-Soft-Delete Flag
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Delete Strategy** section is displayed in Volt MX Foundry Console for **Storage** services. The **Delete Strategy** contains two options:Â **Hard Delete** or **Soft Delete**. It helps you delete the selected record data from the database.

*   Select the **Soft Delete** option to mark the selected record data as a soft delete flag. If you have selected the default **Soft Delete** setting in the **Delete strategy** in Volt MX Foundry Console, and when a client request is sent for deleting records, these records are marked for the **SoftDeleteFlag** with value as `1` in the database. This option is selected by default.
*   Select the **Hard Delete** option to delete the selected record data permanently from the database.
    
    > **_Note:_** To configure the **Delete strategy** for Storage services using the Foundry Console, refer to [ObjectsServices > Storage Endpoint](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/ObjectsServices/Objectservices_Stage1.md).
    

In case you have published your storage service with the default **Soft Delete** option, you can permanently delete the selected records from the database by passing the header (`X-VoltMX-Soft-Delete`) parameter in the **delete request call** by using the Admin Console, as follows:

1.  To use the hard delete option, go to the **App Services Console** > **Object Services** page.
2.  Under the **App Data Model Objects** column, select the object for a specific service of type **Storage**.

3.  In the **Request Input** tab, select the **delete** operation from the list.
    
4.  Click the **Body** section and specify the field value that you want to delete. The field value must be based on a primary key.
5.  Click the **Header** section, and enter the header parameter for the **Hard Delete** operation as follows:
    *   Field Name: `X-VoltMX-Soft-Delete`
    *   Field Value: `false`
6.  Click **Get Response**.
    
    The response for the delete request is displayed under the **Response Output** tab > **Response Body** section.
    
```
//Sample response code for a Hard delete request call  
    Response Body
    
    {
        "records":[],"opstatus":0,"httpStatusCode":0
    }
```
    
    The records mentioned in the request body are deleted.
