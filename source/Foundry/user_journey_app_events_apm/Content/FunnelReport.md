Funnel Reports
--------------

Funnel Reports add new visualization capability to Volt MX analytics that lets a business user to analyze the app usage and the user drop rate in an application by using the form Entry Events captured as part of [User journey and APM](../../../Foundry/user_journey_app_events_apm/Content/App_Events_and_APM_Guide.md). A funnel report provides a quick view of how many users are using the app or a particular feature.

The cloud management portal enables a user to define funnel reports. Administrators and owners of the cloud account will see funnel reports under the Reports tab.

The Funnel Reports tab enables a user create, modify, delete, or save funnel reports. A user can save the reports as private reports (accessible only to the creator) or shared reports (accessible to all users who have permission to view custom reports in that account).

### Use Case

For example, in the case of an e-commerce app, to know the user checkout flow, the steps a business user considers are the end userâ€™s log-in (user logs in to the form named frmLogin), searching a product (frmSearch), adding a product to cart (frmAddToCart), and purchasing the product (frmCheckOut).

The below funnel report displays the flow between the user login (frmLogin) and product checkout (frmCheckOut) process.

The top section of the funnel report provides the count and percentage of total user sessions through the forms in the application.

![](Resources/Images/FRuser-sessions_664x65.png)

In the above scenario, Login form (FRMLOGIN) was visited in 872 sessions, which is 87.2 percent of the total application sessions. Search form (FRMSEARCH) was visited in 850 sessions, AddToCart form (FRMADDTOCART) was visited in 350 sessions and Checkout form(FRMCHECKOUT) was visited in 250 sessions.

The arrows between the forms in the funnel report display the percentage of total users that moved through each of the selected forms in the flow.

![](Resources/Images/FRconversion-rate_677x66.png)

In the above scenario, 97 percent of the user sessions in which users logged in(FRMLOGIN), visited the search form(FRMSEARCH). 41 percent of the user sessions in which user logged in and searched products have added the products to cart (FRMADDTOCART). 71 percent of the user sessions in which users logged in, searched products, and added a product to cart have also purchased the product (FRMCHECKOUT).

The bottom section displays the user drop rate at each chosen point in the flow.

![](Resources/Images/FR-dropRate_693x49.png)

In the above scenario, the funnel report shows that three percent of the users (22 user sessions) who accessed the login form(FRMLOGIN) did not proceed to search a product(FRMSEARCH). 59 percent of the users (500 user sessions) who logged in and searched a product, did not add the product to cart (FRMADDTOCART). In 29 percent of the cases (100 user sessions) where the users have logged in, searched products and added a product to cart did not purchase or checkout the product (FRMCHECKOUT).

The funnel view can provide insights into an app usage for the business user. For example, in the above scenario, funnel report shows that most of the users who logged into the app searched for a product. Most of the users dropped between searching a product (FRMSEARCH) and adding a product to the cart (FRMADDTOCART). The percentage of user who purchased a product is less than percentage of user who added a product to the cart. The above report can be used by a business user to understand the customer behavior and offer discounts accordingly to sell more products.

Funnel reports can be filtered by channel, platform in addition to the date range for which data is being viewed.
