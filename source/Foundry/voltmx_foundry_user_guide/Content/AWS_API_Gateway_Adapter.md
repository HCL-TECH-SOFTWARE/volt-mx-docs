AWS API Gateway Adapter
-----------------------

AWS API Gateway is a new data adapter of Volt MX Foundry integration services. With Volt MX Foundry AWS API Gateway integration service, you can connect to the services configured and deployed under API Gateway Service in Amazon Web Services.

Volt MX Foundry AWS API Gateway supports the following integration types of Amazon API Gateway:

*   Lambda Function
*   HTTP Proxy
*   Mock Integration
*   AWS Service Proxy

> **_Note:_**  Volt MX Foundry supports AWS API Gateway services, which returns JSON response.

### Configure AWS API Gateway Endpoint Adapter

To configure AWS API Gateway service in the **[Integration Service Definition](ConfigureIntegrationService.md)** tab, follow these steps:

1.  In the **Name** field, provide a unique name for your service.
2.  From the **Service Type** list, select **AWS API Gateway**.
3.  Provide the following details in the AWS API Gateway service definiton:  
    
      | Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Regions | Select your region that you have configured AWS API Gateway for your AWS account. |
| AWS URL | It displays the AWS API gateway URL for the selected region. You cannot modify this field. |
| Access Key ID | Enter the access key ID that you received from your AWS account. |
| Secret Access ID | Enter the secret access key ID that you received from your AWS account. |
| Test Connection | Click **Test Connection** to test you AWS connection details. The system displays `Valid Gateway address and port` if the details are correct. |

  
6.  <details close markdown="block"><summary>For additional configuration of your service definition, provide the following details in the **Advanced** section:</summary>

      | Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Custom Code | Custom Code enables you to specify dependent JAR. To specify dependent JAR, select the JAR containing preprocessor or postprocessor libraries from the drop-down list, or click **Upload New** to browse the JAR file from your local system. This step allows you to further filter the data sent to the back end.> **_Important:_** Make sure that you upload a custom JAR file that is built on the same JDK version used for installing Volt MX Foundry Integration.For example, if the JDK version on the machine where Volt MX Foundry Integration is installed is 1.6, you must use the same JDK version to build your custom jar files. If the JDK version is different, an unsupported class version error will appear when a service is used from a device. |
| Throttling | API throttling enables you to limit the number of request calls within a minute. If an API exceeds the throttling limit, it will not return the service response. **To specify throttling in Volt MX Foundry Console, follow these steps:** In the **Total Rate Limit** text box, enter a required value. With this value, you can limit the number of requests configured in your Volt MX Foundry console in terms of Total Rate Limit. In the **Rate Limit Per IP** text box, enter a required value. With this value, you can limit the number of IP address requests configured in your Volt MX Foundry console in terms of Per IP Rate Limit. **To override throttling in App Services Console, refer to** [Override API Throttling Configuration](API_Throttling_Override.md#override-api-throttling-configuration). > **_Note:_** In case of On-premises, the number of nodes in a clustered environment is set by configuring the `VOLTMX_SERVER_NUMBER_OF_NODES` property in the Admin Console. This property indicates the number of nodes configured in the cluster. The default value is 1.Refer to [The Runtime Configuration tab on the Settings screen of App Services](../../../Foundry/vmf_integrationservice_admin_console_userguide/Content/Runtime_Configuration.md). The total limit set in the Volt MX Foundry Console will be divided by the number of configured nodes. For example, a throttling limit of 600 requests/minute with three nodes will be calculated to be 200 requests/minute per node.This is applicable for Cloud and On-premises. |

> **_Note:_** All options in the Advanced section are optional.
    
7.  In the **Description** field, provide a suitable description for the service.
    
8.  To enable the proxy, select the **Use proxy from settings** check box. By default, the check box is cleared.  
    The **Use proxy from settings** check box dims when no proxy is configured under the **[Settings > Proxy](Settings.md#proxy)**.
    
9.  Click **Save** to save your service definition.
    

### Create Operations for AWS API Gateway
