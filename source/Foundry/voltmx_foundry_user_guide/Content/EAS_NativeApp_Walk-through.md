Walk-through of Volt MX Enterprise App Store (EAS) Source Application
=====================================================================

EAS App Implementation
----------------------

Volt MX Enterprise App Store (EAS) is a simplified app distribution service that enables an enterprise to securely and easily distribute and manage apps to the users. All features of Volt MX EAS are available on Cloud and On-Premises. For more information on EAS, refer to [VoltMX Enterprise App Store (EAS) Service for Digital App Distribution](EnterpriseAppStore.md).

From Volt MX AppPlatform V8 SP4 JuneFP onwards, Volt MX allows you to access the complete EAS App assets including the front-end project details and the back-end app. You can download the EAS App assets from the [VoltMX Marketplace](https://marketplace.hclvoltmx.com/). These assets contain the source code of the Enterprise App Store, which is available for you to edit as per your requirement. You may choose to re-brand the app, or add specific forms to best suit your requirements.

For example, you can brand some of the following use cases:

*   Name, Slogan, Style
*   Graphics: Logo, app icon, splash screen, and visual image of the app
*   Look of the app
    
*   Brand keywords

App Architecture under Volt MX Reference Architecture
-----------------------------------------------------

*   **Volt MX Reference Architecture**: Volt MX EAS App is built on the Volt MX Reference Architecture. Volt MX Reference Architecture encapsulates your app's code into Volt MX's implementation of the Model View Controller (MVC) software architecture. Under Volt MX Reference Architecture, the code for your app has a clear division between the domain objects that model the app's functional domain and the presentation objects that represent what the user sees on the screen. Therefore, domain objects work independently of the presentation objects and can support multiple presentations, even simultaneously. Both domain objects and presentation objects are encapsulated into specific modules that Volt MX Reference Architecture generates automatically for you from the user interface that you create in Volt MX Reference Architecture Iris. For more information on Volt MX Reference Architecture Reference Architecture, refer to [A Deeper Look at Volt MX Reference Architecture Reference Architecture](../../../Iris/voltmx_ref_arch_api/Content/MVVM_Overviews_DeeperLook.md).
*   Extensibility and Customization: While Volt MX Reference Architecture EAS provide optimal functionality out of the box, HCL understands that each enterprise has unique requirements. The solutions can be easily extended to support business-specific applications and requirements by leveraging the power of the Volt MX platform. This allows customers to add their own functionality via third-party solutions or their own built-in modules on the Volt MX AppPlatform. For more information on Extensibility and Customization, refer to [Extensibility](https://voltmxsolutions.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ARBD/pages/271811283/Extension+Points#ExtensionPoints-commanpatternBusinessExtensionsusingCommandPattern).
    
    Volt MX EAS is built by using the industry-leading Volt MX Iris and Volt MX Foundry tools, which allow enterprises to customize and extend the following:
    
    *   Look and feel of the application
    *   Business rules that define the application functionality
    *   Rules around the data flow between the device and the back end
    
    Further, the solution includes an extension framework that allows implementation teams to do the following:
    
    *   Introduce a new form in an existing business workflow
    *   Replace an existing business logic method with new implementation
    *   Programmatically add new widgets to existing forms
    *   Update various properties of widgets
    *   Hide a feature that the bank does not need

Prerequisites to Configure EAS Source App in Iris
-------------------------------------------------------

Before you start using the source of the EAS App, ensure you have access to the following:

*   Access to a Volt MX Cloud account. If you do not have a cloud account, you can register for it at [VoltMX Cloud Registration](https://manage.hclvoltmx.com/registration).
*   Access to a Volt MX Cloud Build Environment, Volt MX Iris Starter, and access to Foundry App Server for publishing apps to EAS.

### Modifying Server EAS App for Identity Services and Metadata of Binaries

#### Configuring Identity Services for EAS Authentication

You can configure new Identity Services and Object Services for EAS in the **Volt MX App Store** App. After you configure the new services, you must map the new services in the project and update the source code of the Store project.

#### Configuring Properties for Client Binaries

For information on how to configure basic properties such as the description of a client binary file, the icon of a binary, and the related screenshots of a binary file. refer to [Configuring Properties for Client Binaries in VoltMX Foundry](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/EnterpriseAppStore.md#configuring-properties-for-client-binaries).

Publishing EAS App
------------------

EAS native apps need to be distributed in the same way as you distribute the other native apps. So, to distribute EAS native apps to end-users, you must publish your EAS native apps to the EAS Web app. End-users can access the EAS Web app to view and download EAS native apps on devices like any other native apps. By default, the EAS Web app is selected while publishing the apps to EAS.

### Build and Publish App Binaries to EAS using Volt MX Iris

With Iris Starter, you can build client binaries and publish them directly to Volt MX App Server from Iris. For more information, refer to Publishing Native Apps to Enterprise App Store from Iris Starter.

*   For more information on how to build app binaries and publish them to EAS, refer to [**Publish to Enterprise App Store section** in Publishing Client Binaries to Volt MX App Server from Volt MX Iris (for Cloud only)](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/EAS.md#Publish).
    

### Publish App Binaries to EAS using Volt MX Foundry

By using Volt MX Foundry, you can upload the client binaries and publish them to Volt MX App Server. After an app is published to Volt MX App Server, an authorized end-user can access the EAS Client app to view the available applications and download them using a mobile device.

*   For more information on how to upload app binaries to the Server and publish them to EAS by using Volt MX Foundry, refer to [Publishing Client Binaries to Volt MX App Server from Volt MX Foundry](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/EnterpriseAppStore.md#publishing-client-binaries-to-app-server-from-foundry).
