JSON Adapter
------------

A service that communicates with an external data source using JSON over the HTTP protocol, and returns a response in JSON format is known as a JSON Service. You can use the JSON services in any case where you would use an XML service. But, the response of a JSON service is in a JSON format.

#### Concepts about JSON Adapter

Notations

*   JSON Object - {}
*   JSON Array - \[\]

##### Important Considerations

*   JSON Array will consist of an array of JSON Objects or a blank array.
*   JSON Object is a key value pair. The key is a String and value can be a String, number(int, float,double), JSON Object or JSON Array.
*   JSON string will not contain attributes.
*   JSON path does not provide Axes like Xpath.
*   For JSON Path, if a JSON backend contains a collection, the **parameters set** should be same for all the records in the collection. For example, if the collection has parameters: `name` and `type`, these parameters should be repeated in the backend response, shown in the following sample code:
```

// Sample code from a response:  
{"GlossDef":{"para":"A meta-markup language, used to create markup languages such as DocBook.","GlossSeeAlso":[{"name":"test","type":"XML"},{"name":"tester","type":"HTML"}]}} 
```
*   For XPath, if a JSON backend contains a collection, the fetch `only a parameter from the record`, the XPath should be in `<record>/<collection>[*]/<parameter>`, which includes an `[*]`.
    
    For example, in the previous sample code, if you want to fetch `name` from the `GlossSeeAlso`, the sample XPath should be as follows:
    
```
 
// Sample code to fetch only the **name** parameter from a record, XPath:       
/GlossDef/GlossSeeAlso[*]/name
```

##### Selecting Elements

  
| Element | Description |
| --- | --- |
| _elementname_ | Selects all child elements of the named Element. |
| _//_ | Selects elements in the document from the current element that match the selection no matter where they are. |

##### Example

  
| Path Expression | Result |
| --- | --- |
| bookstore (or) /bookstore | Selects all the child elements of the bookstore element |
| bookstore/book | Selects all book elements that are children of bookstore |
| //book | Selects all book elements no matter where they are in the JSON string |
| bookstore//book | Selects all book elements that are descendant of the bookstore element, no matter where they are under the bookstore element |

##### Predicates

Predicates are used to find a specific element or an element that contains a specific value. Predicates are always embedded in square brackets.

  
| Path Expression | Result |
| --- | --- |
| bookstore/book\[0\] | Selects the first book element that is the child of the bookstore element |
| bookstore/book\[last()\] | Selects the last book element that is the child of the bookstore element |
| bookstore/book\[last()-1\] | Selects the last but one book element that is the child of the bookstore element |
| bookstore/book\[position()<3\] | Selects the first two book elements that are children of the bookstore element |
| bookstore/book\[price>35.00\] | Selects all the book elements of the bookstore element that have a price element with a value greater than 35.00 |
| bookstore/book\[price>35.00\]/title | Selects all the title elements of the book elements of the bookstore element that have a price element with a value greater than 35.00 |

> **_Note:_** If a key name contains a value with a dot (`.`), the path for the same should be in double quotes (`[""]`). For example, if the key in response is `<element1>.<element2>`, the path must be as `["<element1>.<element2>"]`

##### Operators

  
| Operator | Description | Example | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| \> | Greater than | price>9.80 | true if price is 9.90 false if price is 9.80 |
| \>= | Greater than or equal to | price>=9.80 | true if price is 9.90 false if price is 9.70 |
| < | Less than | price<9.80 | true if price is 9.00 false if price is 9.80 |
| != | Not equal | price!=9.80 | true if price is 9.90 false if price is 9.80 |
| \= | Equal | price=9.80 | true if price is 9.80 false if price is 9.90 |

### Configure JSON End-point Adapter

### Configure Request Operation for JSON

Integration services accept only `form-url-encoded` inputs for all input parameters provided in service input parameters (request input).

You can perform the following actions in **Request Input** tab:

1.  Click **Add Parameter**  to add an entry (if the entries for input and the output tabs does not exist).
2.  To make duplicate entries, select the check box for the entry, click **Copy** and **Paste**.
3.  To delete an entry, select the check box for an entry and click **Delete** .
4.  Under the **Body** tab, perform the following actions:
    1.  To forward the body of the client's request to backend as it is, select the **Enable pass-through input body** check box. For more details on API Proxy service, refer to [How to Enable Pass-through Proxy for Operations](API_Proxy_Adapter.md#how-to-enable-pass-through-proxy-for-operations).
        
        ![](Resources/Images/APIProxyBody_534x172.png)
        
    2.  To configure parameters in the clients body, do the following:
        
| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Enter the name for the request input parameter. |
| Value | Three different options are available in Volt MX Foundry under **VALUE** during configuration of any operation. When you start editing this field, dependent identity services are auto populated. These options primarily determine the source of the value of the header**.** **Request**: If this option is selected, the Integration Server picks the value pairs from the client's request during run time and forwards the same to the back-end.User has the option to configure the default value. This default value is taken if the request does not have the header.**Session**: If this option is selected, the value of header is picked from session context based on the user configuration.**Identity**: If this option is selected, you can filter the request parameters based on the response from the identity provider. For more details to configure identity filters, refer to [Enhanced Identity Filters - Integration Services](Identity_Filters_Integration.md). **_Note:_** The field is set to **Request**, by default. |
| TEST VALUE | Enter a value. A test value is used for testing the service. |
| DEFAULT VALUE | Enter the value, if required. The default value will be used if the test value is empty. |
| Scope | Select request or session. This field is set to **Request**, by default. |
| Encode | Select the checkbox to enable an input parameter to be encoded. For example, the name New York Times would be encoded as _New_York_Times_  when the encoding is set to True. The encoding must also adhere the HTML URL encoding standards. |
        
5.  Click the **Header** tab to provide the following custom headers for an operation.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/APIProxyHeader_559x109.png)
    
    You must provide the custom HTTP headers based on the operation. For example, post or get.
    
    Perform the following actions to provide the custom header:
    
    1.  To forward headers of the client's request to backend as it is, select the **Enable pass-through input header** check box. For more details on API Proxy service, refer to [How to Enable Pass-through Proxy for Operations](API_Proxy_Adapter.md#how-to-enable-pass-through-proxy-for-operations).
    2.  To configure parameters in the client's header, do the following:
        
| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Provide custom HTTP headers required by the external source. |
| Value | Three different options are available in Volt MX Foundry under **VALUE** during configuration of any operation. When you start editing this field, dependent identity services are auto populated. These options primarily determine the source of the value of the header**.** **Request**: If this option is selected, the Integration Server picks the value pairs from the client's request during run time and forwards the same to the back-end.User has the option to configure the default value. This default value is taken if the request does not have the header.**Session**: If this option is selected, the value of header is picked from session context based on the user configuration.**Identity**: If this is selected, you can filter the request parameters based on the response from the identity provider. For more details to configure identity filters, refer to [Enhanced Identity Filters - Integration Services](Identity_Filters_Integration.md). **_Note:_** The field is set to **Request**, by default.> **_Note:_** If the header value is scoped as a **Request** (or) **Session** and the same header is accessed under the **Expression** header value, then the expression must be represented as $request.header (or) $session.header.**Example**: If a header 1 value is a request and header 2 value is an expression, then the value of the expression must be $Request.header1.![](Resources/Images/Integration_requestandsessionheader.png) |
| TEST VALUE | Enter a value. A test value is used for testing the service. |
| DEFAULT VALUE | Change the syntax, if required. The default value will be used if the test value is empty. |
| Description | Enter a proper description. |
        
6.  You can add pre and post processing logic to services to modify the request inputs. When you test, the services details of various stages are displayed in the service execution for better debugging. You can refer to [Test a Service Operation](Test_a_Service_Operation.md) for the steps to test a service.

### Configure Response Operation for JSON

Click **Response Output** tab to configure the fields of the table for displaying the data.

![](Resources/Images/APIProxyOutput_589x147.png)

> **_Note:_** If you define parameters inside a record as the session, the session scope will not get reflected for the parameters.

1.  To forward the response from the backend to the client as it is, select the **Enable pass-through output body** check box. For more details on API Proxy service, refer to [How to Enable Pass-through Proxy for Operations](API_Proxy_Adapter.md#how-to-enable-pass-through-proxy-for-operations).
2.  You can configure XPath or JSON path expressions for extracting the required elements from the back-end response of the service call. So that the extracted output can be sent to the client app. Based on the path expression selected in the service definition, you can create an XPath or JSON path **manually**. For JSON services only, JSON Path can be auto-generated.
    
    > **_Note:_** Auto generation of XPath support is available from Volt MX Foundry V8 SP3 onwards.
    
    The following table details XPath/JSON generation:

    | 
    After you click **Save and Fetch Response**, the **Tree** view with the back-end response appears by default in the **Test >** **Backend Response** pane. Click or hover your mouse cursor over the node for which you want to create JSON Path. The **Create response** button appears next to that node. Click the **Create response** button.![](Resources/Images/CreateResponse_220x114.png) A new row is created automatically along with the JSON Path for the selected node in the Response Output tab. > **_Note:_** The **Response Output** tab appears if you have clicked the **Create response** button from the Request Input tab.
    
      > **_Important:_** If you have selected the **Path Expression** as **JSON Path**, in the **Response Output** tab, the **Add All to Response Output** cogwheel is displayed. You can generate JSON Path for the entire response by clicking the **Add All to Response Output** button. ![](Resources/Images/GenerateAllJSON.png) | 
    
    Click **Add Parameter** to add new row. Click the **Tree** button in the **Backend Response** tab. This displays the backend response in a tree structure format. Click the node for which you want to create XPath/JSON Path. The XPath/JSON Path for that node is displayed at the bottom of the Tree structure.![](Resources/Images/NodePath_233x190.png) Enter that XPath/JSON Path in the row that you have created.
