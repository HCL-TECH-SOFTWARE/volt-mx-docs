User Guide: Continuous Integration with Volt MX Foundry MFCLI

# Continuous Integration with Volt MX Foundry

[Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) is a key modern day software development practice. Any software development project doing Agile development probably would be doing Continuous Integration (CI) too.

Volt MX Foundry being a SDLC tool, supports Continuous Integration.  Volt MX Foundry has REST APIs for import/export of an application and publish/unpublish of an application to facilitate CI.  You can consume these REST APIs directly if needed.  For this, refer to the [Continuous Integration with Volt MX Foundry APIs](CI_with_Foundry_APIs.md)documentation.

While deploying the application to different environments, you may need to reconfigure certain properties, such as the end-point URL to which the application should talk in the production environment. For these kind of reconfiguration, you can use the [Reconfiguration at Publish](ReconfigPublish.md) support. You can set environment specific properties as one time activity using Volt MX Foundry Console and these will automatically get applied during publish in CI flow.

## Volt MX Foundry Command Line Utility

Using REST APIs may not be ideal in some cases.  For example, a developer uses a shell script for Continuous Integration, then calls REST APIs and does all the response handling. The process can become tedious and time-consuming.  To make such scenarios easier, we offer Volt MX Foundry Command Line Utility.  The utility helps you export/import or publish/unpublish an application on on-premise Volt MX Foundry and Volt MX Cloud environments.

### Download Links

Volt MX Foundry Command Line Utility can be downloaded from [VoltMX download center](https://hclsoftware-fno.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operations/startPage).

### Examples

This section will help you better understand the utility. For example, company MoBoCo is developing the app MoBoApp. Some of the app's developers use the development environment called DevEnv1. As part of the continuous integration job that runs every night, the team wants to push the MoBoApp from DevEnv1 to QAEnv1 . The team wants automation and testing to occur at night and the following day. Consider the following scenarios.

**Scenario 1 – Promoting an app from the local development environment to local QA environment every night**

There is **one Volt MX Foundry Console connected to two environments – DevEnv1 and QAEnv1**.  The following image shows the Volt MX Foundry topology:

![](Resources/Images/CI_MF_655x372.png)

Using the preceding topology to promote the MoBoApp from DevEnv1 to QAEnv1 every night, a user can do the following:

```
 java -jar mfcli.jar Publish -u ciuser@moboco.com -p ciuserpwd -e QAEnv1 -a MoBoApp -au http://10.10.25.18:8080 -cu http://10.10.25.18:8080
```

Here, ciuser@moboco.com is the user with password ciuserpwd. The user's account helps to promote the MoBoApp to QAEnv1. Identity (Auth) Service and Console are running on http://10.10.25.18:8080. You can also encrypt the password before exporting an app.

> **_Note:_** The publish command could be used to publish a new application or to overwrite an existing application.

The following example shows how the publish command is used:

```
 To publish an application from an on-premise installation,  
java -jar mfcli.jar Publish -u [user] -p [password] -e [environment name] -a [app name] -au [Identity Service URL] -cu [Console URL]
```

If the end-point URL or any other property is different in QA environment, you can use the [Application Reconfiguration](ServiceReconfig.md) support to set these properties at one time action in Volt MX Foundry Console. The environment specific properties will automatically get applied every time you publish.

**Scenario 2 – Promoting an app from the local development environment to QA environment running on Volt MX Cloud every night**

This case is more complex. Developers are working against a local environment (DevEnv1), but QA is testing through an environment in Volt MX Cloud (QAEnv1). There are **two MF Consoles**. The example is a hybrid scenario of on-premise and the cloud. The following image shows the Volt MX Foundry topology:

![](Resources/Images/CI_Cloud_663x412.png)

In this example, a user needs to perform the following four steps:

1.  Encrypt the password of a user who needs to promote the MoBoApp  to  QAEnv1account.
2.  Export the app from DevEnv1 (as a .zip file).
3.  Import the app (as a .zip file) into Volt MX Cloud account.
4.  Publish the app to QAEnv1.

### Minor difference between on-premise Volt MX Foundry and Volt MX Cloud

The command line utility supports on-premise Volt MX Foundry and Volt MX Cloud. However, there are minor differences in command-line arguments. For on-premise, the utility needs to know the URL of the Identity Services and Console. For Volt MX Cloud, since the URL is constant ([](https://manage.hclvoltmx.com/)[https://manage.hclvoltmx.com](https://manage.hclvoltmx.com/)), and is hard-coded into the utility for convenience. However, Volt MX Cloud is a multiple account (tenant) service, and a user must specify the account ID using –t option. The Volt MX Cloud account ID is a nine-digit number (such as 100054321) and is located in the top-right corner of the console.

In the scenario, a user must perform the following steps:

1.  **Encrypt the password**.


    To encrypt the password, run the following command.

```
 java -jar mfcli.jar  encrypt password ciuserpwd
```

    An encrypted password is generated for the preceding ciuserpwd. Use the encrypted password in the following commands in the scenario.

2.  **Export the app from DevEnv1 (as a zip file)**


    To export the app, a user must run the following command.

```
 java -jar mfcli.jar Export -u ciuser@moboco.com -p encrypted_password -a MoBoApp –f .\MoBoApp.zip -au http://10.10.25.18:8080 -cu http://10.10.25.18:8080.
```

In the scenario, ciuser@moboco.com is the user with password  encrypted_password. The user's account helps to export the MoBoApp as MoBoApp.zip. The Identity (Auth) Services and console are running on http://10.10.25.18:8080.

The following is an example of how the export command is used:

```


To export an application from an on premise installation,

java -jar mfcli.jar Export -u [user] -p [encrypted_password] -a [app name] -f [file name] -au [Identity URL] -cu [Console URL]

```8. **Import the app (as a zip file) into Volt MX Cloud Account**
```
 java -jar mfcli.jar Import -u ciuser@moboco.com -p encrypted_password -a MoBoApp –f .\MoBoApp.zip –t 100054321
```

In the example, ciuser@moboco.com is the user with encrypted_password. The user's account helps to import the MoBoApp from MoBoApp.zip.

> **_Note:_** Since no URL is provided for Identity Service and console, it is assumed that the URL is Volt MX Cloud ([](https://manage.hclvoltmx.com/)[https://manage.hclvoltmx.com](https://manage.hclvoltmx.com/)). Since Volt MX Cloud is a multiple tenants (account) service, a user must specify the account ID using –t. The account ID in the preceding example is 100054321.

> **_Note:_** In the example, it is assumed a user is trying to overwrite the existing MoBoApp in the account. If this is new application, then do not specify any name with -a option.

The following is an example of how the import command is used:

```


To import an application to manage.hclvoltmx.com,

java -jar mfcli.jar import -u <user> -p <password> -t <account id> [-f <file name> | -r <directory name>] [-a <app name>] [-v <app version>] [-ay] [-to <time in secs>]

```14. **Publish the app to QAEnv1**
```
 java -jar mfcli.jar Publish -u ciuser@moboco.com -p encrypted_password -e QAEnv1 -a MoBoApp –t 100054321
```

This method is similar to local publish, except the -t option specifies the account ID.

The following is an example of how the publish command is used:

```
 To publish an application to manage.hclvoltmx.com,

java -jar mfcli.jar Publish -u [user] -p [encrypted_password] -e [environment name] -a [app name] -t [account id]
```

If the end-point URL or any other property is different in QA environment running on Volt MX Cloud, you can use the [Application Reconfiguration](ServiceReconfig.md) support to set these properties at one time action in Volt MX Foundry Console. The environment specific properties will automatically get applied every time you publish.

#### Unpublish Command

The Unpublish feature helps you undo the publish command. The syntax for the Unpublish command is that same as the publish command's. For republish, do not unpublish.  To overwrite an existing publish, republish by executing the publish command again.  When a user does unpublish, all of the app's metadata are removed. The next publish creates fresh metadata, such as a new app key/secret. In case of republishing, when a user does publish multiple times to republish an app, all of the app's metadata are retained.

#### Authenticate API

If you have log in credentials, this authenticate command helps you to get the Auth Token out of your login credentials. For example, you can use this command to get a valid Volt MX Identity token and be able to use that token with subsequent REST API calls to interact directly like using Engagement service APIs or AppFactory APIs.

The API supports for Volt MX Auth and External auth services.

```
for Volt MX Cloud (manage.hclvoltmx.com) environment,
java -jar mfcli.jar authenticate -u <user> -p <password> -t <account id>
java -jar mfcli.jar authenticate -u abc@voltmx.com -p password -t 100054321
```
```
for on-premise installation,
java -jar mfcli.jar authenticate -u <user> -p <password> -au <Identity URL> -cu <Console URL>
java -jar mfcli.jar authenticate -u abc@voltmx.com -p password -au http://10.10.24.79:8080 -cu http://10.10.24.78:8081
```
```
To use external authentication
java -jar mfcli.jar authenticate -u <user> -p <pasword> -t <accountid> --external-auth
```

#### Force Release Lock

This utility guarantees a consistent operation during the preceding import/export/publish/unpublish commands.  The utility ensures that only one such operation per app occurs at a given time.  To do this, the utility takes a lock in the database. If there is a software defect, the DB lock is not freed. A user can use --release-lock to force the lock release. This option should be used with caution because it can cancel any existing app publish.
