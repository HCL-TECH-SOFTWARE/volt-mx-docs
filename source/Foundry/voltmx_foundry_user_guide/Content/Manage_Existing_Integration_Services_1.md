How to Save or Use a Version of a Service
-----------------------------------------

You can save an integration service to a new version. Saving a new version of an integration service unlinks the current version of the service from the Volt MX Foundry application, and links the new version. A Volt MX Foundry app can be associated with only one version of an integration service.

> **_Note:_** For more details on API Versioning Use Cases, refer to [VoltMX Foundry API Versioning](API_Versioning.md#API_Versioning.html)

To create a new version of an Integration service, follow these steps:

1.  On the **Integration** tab, click the name of a service in the list of existing services. You can also select Edit from the Operations menu for a service.
    
    The **Service Definition** tab appears.
    
2.  Click the **Version** menu.

3.  Select **Save as new version**.
    
    The **Save as** dialog appears.
    
4.  Type the version number of the new version of the service.
    
    You can use _major.minor_ numbering for versions. Volt MX Foundry supports major versions from 1 through 999, and minor versions from 0 through 99. Volt MX Foundry supports version numbers from 1.0 to 999.99. Note that the dot '.' is a separator for version numbers and does not function as a decimal.
    
5.  Add a description of the new version.
6.  Click **OK**.
    
    Volt MX Foundry links the new version of the service to the Volt MX Foundry app, and unlinks the previous version.
    

To use a different version of an integration service, follow these steps:

1.  On the **Integration** tab, click the name of a service in the list of existing services. You can also select Edit from the Operations menu for a service.
    
    The **Service Definition** tab appears.
    
2.  Click the **Version** menu.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/OrchSrvcVersion_624x276.png)
    
3.  Select a version of the service.
    
4.  The **Alert** dialog appears. The Alert warns you that you are unlinking the current associated version of the service from the application.
    
5.  Click **OK**.
    
    Volt MX Foundry links the version that you selected to the Volt MX Foundry application.

Test the Login for an OAuth 2.0 Identity Service
------------------------------------------------

When you are defining an operation for an integration service, you can request that Volt MX Foundry fetch the response to the operation. If the integration service uses an OAuth 2.0 identity service for authorization, you must log in to the identity service before Volt MX Foundry can fetch the response from the back end.

When you first request that Volt MX Foundry fetch the response, the service does not yet have the required token. You can then authorize Volt MX Foundry to generate the token. Volt MX Foundry then pops up the sign in for the OAuth 2.0 identity provider. After you successfully sign in to the identity service, Volt MX Foundry sends the request with the identity to the OAuth 2.0 back end. Volt MX Foundry gets the token and stores it in a cookie for Volt MX Foundry on the browser. Volt MX Foundry sends the token to the back end, and because the back end has the valid OAuth 2.0 token, the back end sends its response. The back end populates the identity backend response, the backend response, and the output result.

For the lifetime of the session, you can test an operation and you are not required to sign in again. In the identity backend response, you can view the token and clear the token if you want to test the login again.

To test the log in for an identity service, do the following:

1.  Click **Fetch Response**.

The **Identity Backend Response** tab appears. Volt MX Foundry identifies that the integration service is linked to an OAuth identity service. A message informs you that the service needs a backend token. If the message does not appear, the integration service has the backend token.

![](Resources/Images/OAuthAuthorize_605x182.png)

4.  Click **Authorize**.

The sign in screen for the identity service appears.

6.  Enter your credentials and click **Sign In**.

The backend response is populated in the response pane.

8.  To clear the cached token, in the Identity Backend Response tab, click **Clear Token**.

In the Identity Backend Response tab, you can click **Copy** to copy the results of the response to the clipboard. Click **Expand** to open the Identity Backend Response in its own window.

> **_Important:_** If a custom integration service (for example, MongoDB or RAML) is linked to an OAuth2 identity service, while testing an operation of the integration service from VoltMX Foundry Console, you must pass the `x-volt-mx-oauth2-access-token` as header and `access_token` as header value.  
  
Also, If a custom integration service (for example, MongoDB or RAML) is linked to an OAuth2 identity service, while testing an operation of the integration service from Admin Console, you must pass the `x-volt-mx-oauth2-access-token`  as header and `access_token` as header value.  
  
For example:
