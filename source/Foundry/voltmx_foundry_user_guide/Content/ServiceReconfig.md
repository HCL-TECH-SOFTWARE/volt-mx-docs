Service Reconfiguration
=======================

In an Enterprise, as a best practice, the development enterprise backend systems are maintained separately from the production enterprise backend systems. Foundry supports the ability to follow the best practice by providing DEV, QA and PROD environments. DEV and QA environments are typically configured to communicate with development enterprise backend and PROD is configured to communicate with Production enterprise backend.

Service Reconfiguration lets you use the same service against different environments by providing the ability to change the connection parameters to a backend while publishing an app to an environment.

> **_Important:_** **Full** publish method is selected by default, you can switch to **Incremental** publish to reduce publish duration. Refer to [Publish > Delta Publish](Publish.md).

Use Case
--------

You can use service reconfiguration based on the following scenarios:

A developer can use an app configuration in the current workspace and publish the reconfigured app to another environment. A developer can reconfigure only a few entities (such as base URL, User ID, and password).

For example, currently, an endpoint URL of an integration service of the app is configured as `https://qa.sample.com`, which is a QA environment. But after an app is published in a PROD environment, a developer wants the integration service to communicate to a production endpoint - for example, `https://sample.com`. In such cases, a developer can reconfigure the endpoint URL from http://sample.test.com  to  https://sample.com, and publish the app to a PROD environment. 

Reconfiguring a Service  

--------------------------

To reconfigure a service from the **Publish** tab, do the following:

1.  From the **Services and Web Client** tab, select the required environment.
2.  Click **Configure and Publish**. The **Configuration** page is displayed.  
    [![](Resources/Images/AppReconfigPublish1_thumb_0_48.png)](Resources/Images/AppReconfigPublish1.png)
3.  Select the required service type from the list. You can also configure the [app](AppReconfig.md) related information from here. The service types available in the list are as follows:
    *   Identity Services
    *   Integration Services
    *   Object Service
4.  The app displays the selected service details with default connection parameters and configurable connection parameters.

The list of the configurable connection parameters vary for each service type. Following is the list of configurable connection parameters with respect to each service type and adapter.

    *   **Service Name**: Click **Service Name** if you want to view the services in an alphabetical order based on the service names. The system displays all the details of each service in this view.
        
        > **_Note:_**   By default, the list view is set to **View By as Service Name** and **Show Content as All Values**.
        
        ![](Resources/Images/ServiceName_547x183.png)
        
    *   **Service Type**: Click **Service Type** if you want to group the services based on the service type. To view details in each service type, click the **Plus** icon and expand the service.
        
        ![](Resources/Images/ServiceType_552x184.png)
        
*   In **Show Content**, you can select the required option to change the view of the content within the service based on their values. The options available are as follows:
    *   **All Values**: Click **All Values** if you want to view all values including reconfigured values for the selected filter in the **View By** section.  
        For example, if you change User ID and Password for Salesforce service, shown below.
        
        ![](Resources/Images/AllValues_555x110.bmp)  
        
    *   **Edited Values**: Click **Edited Values** if you want to view only the reconfigured values for the selected filter in the **View By** section.  
        For example, if you change User ID and Password for Salesforce service, shown below.
        
        ![](Resources/Images/Edited_Values_551x107.bmp)
        
*   In the work area, follow these steps to reconfigure values in the services:
    1.  To change any value, click the value. For example, to change the base URL, click it.
        
        ![](Resources/Images/Reconfig1.png)
        
        The system displays the value in the text box, and the **save** and **cancel** buttons next to the text box.
        
        ![](Resources/Images/Reconfig2.png)
        
    2.  Edit the value in the text box . For example, change  `com`   to  `net`.
        
        > **_Important:_**  When you reconfigure a value, click the **save** button to save the changes. If you click anywhere else on the page, the changes will be lost, and you will get only the previous data.
        
    3.  Click **save**. The system adds an **undo** button next to each reconfigured values.
        
        ![](Resources/Images/Reconfig3.png)
        
*   Click **SAVE & PUBLISH** to start the publishing.

You can also do the following tasks from the service details page:

*   [Compare Reconfigured Integration Services](#compare-reconfigured-services)
*   [Reset Values for Reconfigured Integration Services](#reset-values-for-reconfigured-services)

Reconfigure the Schema Name in Relational Database Connectors
-------------------------------------------------------------

In **Integration Service Configuration**, you can reconfigure the schema name in Relational Database Connectors using JSON. To reconfigure the schema name, follow these steps:

*   Under **Schema Mapping JSON**, click against the service to enter the schema name.
    
    **For example**, To change the schema name from dev to QA, enter the JSON value and click **Save**.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/Schema_JSON.png)
    
    *   `test_abc` - Schema on which operations are selected.
    *   `test_123` - Schema on which run time operations must be performed.

The system adds an **undo** button next to each reconfigured value.

*   Click **Save and Publish** to start the publishing.

Compare Reconfigured Services  

--------------------------------

In the service details page, after you reconfigure values of services, you can compare the details of all services. You cannot edit any fields in the compare dialog.

1.  In the App configuration page, click **Configurations** on the required service configuration row.  
    ![](Resources/Images/config_and_publish1_576x301.png)  
    
    The system displays the **Current Environment Configuration Vs Definition Values** dialog box.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/compaReconfig_593x161.png)
    

*   Service Name: Displays the service name.
*   Parameter: Displays the field name that is reconfigurable.
*   Default Value: Displays the value configured in the design time.
*   Current Env. Value:Displays reconfigured value in the current environment.
*   Edited Value: Displays the edited value for the selected environment.
    
    > **_Important:_**  In the **Current Environment Configuration Vs Definition Values** dialog box, the values in the **Current Env. Value**  and  **Edited Value** fields are updated to an environment only when you click **SAVE & PUBLISH**.
    

3.  Click the **Close** button at the top-right corner to exit the dialog.

Reset Values for Reconfigured Services
--------------------------------------

In the service details page, after you reconfigure values of services, you can reset the values to the default configuration or to the current environment configuration.  
![](Resources/Images/reset1.PNG)  

> **_Important:_**  When you modify a field and save the service, the system overrides old values with the new values in the current environment clipboard.

To reset to default values, follow these steps:

*   **Reset to Default Value**: After you reconfigure a value in the work area, and when you choose **Reset to Default Value**, the system resets the reconfigured values to the default values that are configured in the current workspace - for example, Developer environment.
*   **Reset to Current Environment Config**: Contains last saved values. After you reconfigure a value in the work area, when you choose **Reset to Current Environment Config**, the system resets all values to the current environment (last saved values).
