Foundry Admin Adapter
====================

From V9SP1, a new type of integration connector â€” **Foundry Admin** has been introduced in Foundry. The Foundry Admin Adapter allows the use of administrative functions (exposed via secure APIs ) on a Foundry runtime server. This permits external systems to invoke these APIs to read or modify settings on the Foundry server.

Managing and Customizing Rules
------------------------------

The Foundry Admin adapter exposes APIs for managing and customizing rules published to a target runtime server.

*   With the Foundry Admin Adapter, you can invoke the Admin endpoints for rules services and manage the published business rules logic. These operations include getting a list of rulesets published to an environment, fetching rules given a ruleset name, read a base rule and custom rule of a particular rule version, create/update custom rules logic, delete a custom rule, and get status of custom rules update/delete actions.  
    
*   With the Foundry Admin Adapter, a Business administration app (for example, `Spotlight`) can access and manage business rules of an Online banking client app. This is to ensure that external clients get the flexibility of customizing its Business Rules without having to change the application or publish the Foundry app again and again.
    
*   For this, the Online banking app should expose the Rules management APIs via the Foundry Admin Adapter. The Spotlight Foundry app should talk to these Rules management APIs (as part of Foundry Admin Adapter) through a JSON integration service.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/AdminAdapter-UseCase_816x476.png)
    

Use Case: Modifying base rules logic dynamically on the run-time server by using a client, for example, Customer 360 (Spotlight)

Consider the following examples:

*   Banks might want to from time-to-time review and update the eligibility criteria for a particular banking product.
*   Based on a customer segment, Bank might want to offer some pre-approved credit card products.
*   During festive seasons, Banks might want to run promotional campaigns for Car Loans and so modify the Business rules to arrive at qualifying customers.

In all of these scenarios, it is noticed that the Business Rules need to be updated by a Bank Manager or Bank Employee through Customer 360 (Spotlight). In order to facilitate this, Rules in Foundry provides the option to update the Rule logic (the MVEL logic a developer configured while developing the App), while retaining the Input and Output parameters that the Rule accepts. This way, a consumer banking app like Online banking or Loans/ Mortgage could get the flexibility of customizing its Rule logic without having to change the application or publish the Foundry app again and again. And by updating and customizing the Rule logic through a Business admin app like Customer 360 (Spotlight), Banks can be guaranteed that only a Bank Manager persona is able to update the Rule logic and no one else without the requisite authority can change those business rules.

**Prerequisites**

*   A Foundry app should contain a **rules set** configured using the Rules Service and the app should be **published to an environment**. For more information on Rules, refer to [Rules as a Service](Rules_as_a_Service.md).
*   A Foundry app should contain a **Foundry Admin** integration service and the app should be published to **the same environment** where you have published your rules services.
    
    > **_Important:_** The Rules service and the Admin adapter integration services can be in the same app or separate apps. If these services are created in separate apps, these two apps should be published in the same environment.
    
    > **_Note:_** Since the Foundry Admin adapter exposes the Administrative functions on the runtime server, only an authorized user should be able to access them. Hence only the Authenticated App User and Private security levels are supported. Anonymous and Public security levels are not supported for the operations exposed in this adapter.
    

Perform the following steps to Invoke the Rules Admin APIs using the Foundry Admin Adapter
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*   [Step1: Configure a **Rules Service** and publish it to an environment](#step1-configure-a-and-publish-it-to-an-environment)
*   [Step2: Configure an Integration Service using the **Foundry Admin** adapter](#step2-configure-an-integration-service-using-the-adapter)  
    
*   [Step3: Configure the Operations for Managing the Rules](#step3-configure-the-operations-for-managing-the-rules)
*   [Step4: Publish the Foundry app containing the Integration Service to that environment](#step4-publish-th)

### **Step1: Configure a **Rules Service** and publish it to an environment**

1.  Create a Foundry app containing a **rules set** of a Rules Service.  
    For more in formation on Rules, refer to [Rules as a Service](Rules_as_a_Service.md).
2.  Publish the app to an environment, for example, **A**.

### Step2: Configure an Integration Service using the **Foundry Admin** adapter

> **_Note:_** The Foundry Admin adapter integration service can be configured in the same Foundry App that you created in Step1. Or it can be in a different app.

To configure the Foundry Admin Adapter in the **[Integration service definition](ConfigureIntegrationService.md)** tab, follow these steps:

1.  In the **Name** field, provide a unique name for your service.
2.  From the **Service Type** list, select _Foundry Admin_.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/AdminAdapter_571x375.png)
    
3.  In the **Authentication** section, the Use Existing Identity Provider list displays the existing Identity services available in the Volt MX Foundry App. Select an Identity Service from the list. This will add a security layer onto your Foundry Admin service. If you select an Identity Service, you must provide appropriate login details to invoke the Admin APIs from the client app.
4.  <details close markdown="block"><summary>The Advanced section contains the following additional configurations. You can configure them if required:</summary>
    
    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Custom Code | Custom Code enables you to specify dependent JAR. To specify dependent JAR, select the JAR containing preprocessor or postprocessor libraries from the drop-down list, or click **Upload New** to browse the JAR file from your local system. This step allows you to further filter the data sent to the back end. <br><br> **_Important:_** Make sure that you upload a custom JAR file that is built on the same JDK version used for installing Volt MX Foundry Integration.For example, if the JDK version on the machine where Volt MX Foundry Integration is installed is 1.6, you must use the same JDK version to build your custom jar files. If the JDK version is different, an unsupported class version error will appear when a service is used from a device. |
    | Throttling | API throttling enables you to limit the number of request calls within a minute. If an API exceeds the throttling limit, it will not return the service response. <br><br>**To specify throttling in Volt MX Foundry Console, follow these steps:** <br><br>In the **Total Rate Limit** text box, enter a required value. With this value, you can limit the number of requests configured in your Volt MX Foundry console in terms of Total Rate Limit. <br><br>In the **Rate Limit Per IP** text box, enter a required value. With this value, you can limit the number of IP address requests configured in your Volt MX Foundry console in terms of Per IP Rate Limit.<br><br> **To override throttling in App Services Console, refer to** [Override API Throttling Configuration](API_Throttling_Override.md#override-api-throttling-configuration). <br><br> **_Note:_** Enable API throttling in a clustered environment by configuring the VOLTMX\_SERVER\_NUMBER\_OF\_NODES property in the **server\_configuration** table available in Admin database. This property indicates the number of nodes configured in the cluster. The default value is 1. |

For more details on API Proxy service, refer toÂ [](#APIProxyCheckBox)[How to Enable Pass-through Proxy for Operations](API_Proxy_Adapter.md#how-to-enable-pass-through-proxy-for-operations).

### Step4: Publish th**e Foundry app containing the Integration Service to that environment**

1.  Publish the Integration Service using the **Foundry Admin** to the same environment where you published your rules services in [Step1](#step1-configure-a-and-publish-it-to-an-environment).
    
    > **_Important:_** The Rules Set of a Rules Service and the Foundry Admin adapter integration services can be in the same app, or separate apps.  
    \- **Different Foundry apps**: If you have created a rules set of a Rules Service in one Foundry app, and the Foundry Admin integration service in another Foundry app, both these apps should be published to the same environment.
