# Preface

Volt MX Foundry is a Mobile Back-end as a Service (MBaaS) provider that helps developers build native and web apps for mobile. Various back-end services are easily integrated with the application irrespective of whether the application is built using JavaScript, PhoneGap, iOS, or Android frameworks.

VoltMXFoundry allows you to define the back-end to build native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and HTML5-based apps for modern browsers. Volt MX Foundry ensures that developers build mobile applications quickly by focusing on core areas and obtaining secured back-end services instantly. Volt MX Foundry has multiple features that can be used - Identity, Integration, Orchestration, Objects, Logic, and Engagement Services. These features can be accessed through a common, centralized console.

For successful authentication with users, and to access the centralized features of Volt MX Foundry, HCL recommends that you install the following Volt MX Foundry features:

- Volt MX Foundry Identity and Console
- API Developer Portal
- Volt MX Foundry Integration
- Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services

Volt MX Foundry supports the following back-end services for your applications:

- **Identity**: This feature allows you to define the type of authentication used for granting access to your application. Volt MX Foundry supports the following authentication services:

  - Enterprise Identity: Microsoft Active Directory, Open LDAP, Salesforce, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), SAP Gateway, OAuth 2.0, Okta, Custom, and OAuth Provider.

  - _Social Identity_: Google, Instagram, Microsoft, BOX, Facebook, LinkedIn, Amazon, and Yahoo.

- **API Developer Portal**: This feature allows you to directly access your Volt MX Developer Portal in Volt MX Foundry Console.
- **Integration**: This feature allows you to define various back-end services for your application. You can define the following integration services:
  - **Technology Adapters**: XML, SOAP, JSON, Java, JavaScript, and APIProxy.
  - **Business Adapters**: SAP Gateway, MuleSoft, AWSAPIGateway, Relational Database, MongoDB, RAML, OpenAPI (Swagger), Salesforce, and IBM MQ.
- **Orchestration**: Service orchestration is the coordination or integration of several services and exposing them as a single service. This feature allows you to create two types of orchestration services. They are:
  - Composite: Allows you to run two or more services concurrently or sequentially.
  - Looping: Allows you to run a single service in a loop until the loop ends or an exit criteria is met.
- **Objects**: Allows you to create app models for LOB objects, storage objects, and Service-Driven Objects.
- **Offline sync**: This feature allows you to define the synchronization services for your application. Sync supports only Web Services, except SAP Sky.
- **Logic**: The logic services feature in Volt MX Foundry helps you import and integrate Node.js services (APIs) directly into Volt MX Foundry for developing server-side and networking applications.
- **Engagement**: This feature allows you to send push notifications, email, SMS and passes to subscribed applications.
