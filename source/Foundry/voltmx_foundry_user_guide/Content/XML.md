       ![](Resources/Images/APIProxyBody_534x172.png)
        
    2.  To configure parameters in the clients body, do the following:

    | Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Enter the name for the request input parameter. |
| Value | Three different options are available in Volt MX Foundry under **VALUE** during configuration of any operation. When you start editing this field, dependent identity services are auto populated. These options primarily determine the source of the value of the header.<br><br>Select request or session or Identity.<br>**Request**: If this option is selected, the Integration Server picks the value pairs from the client's request during run time and forwards the same to the back-end.User has the option to configure the default value. This default value is taken if the request does not have the header.<br><br>**Session**: If this option is selected, the value of header is picked from session context based on the user configuration.<br><br>**Identity**: If this option is selected, you can filter the request parameters based on the response from the identity provider. For more details to configure identity filters, refer to [Enhanced Identity Filters - Integration Services](Identity_Filters_Integration.md#enhanced-identity-filters-integration-services).<br><br>**_Note:_** The field is set to **Request**, by default. |
| TEST VALUE | Enter a value. A test value is used for testing the service. |
| DEFAULT VALUE | Enter the value, if required. The default value will be used if the test value is empty. |
| Scope | Select request or session. This field is set to **Request**, by default. |
| DATA TYPE | The default data type for the selected column is loaded under the DATA TYPE field. |
| Encode | Select the checkbox to enable an input parameter to be encoded. For example, the name New York Times would be encoded as _New_York_Times_  when the encoding is set to True. The encoding must also adhere the HTML URL encoding standards. |
| Description | Enter the description for the Request Input parameter. |
        
5.  Click the **Header** tab to provide the following custom headers for an operation.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/APIProxyHeader_559x109.png)
    
    You must provide the custom HTTP headers based on the operation. For example, post or get.
    
    Perform the following actions to provide the custom header
    
    1.  To forward headers of the client's request to backend as it is, select the **Enable pass-through input header** check box. For more details on API Proxy service, refer to [How to Enable Pass-through Proxy for Operations](#APIProxyCheckBox).
    2.  To configure parameters in the client's header, do the following:
        
      | Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Provide custom HTTP headers required by the external source. |
| Value | Three different options are available in Volt MX Foundry under **VALUE** during configuration of any operation. When you start editing this field, dependent identity services are auto populated. These options primarily determine the source of the value of the header.<br><br>Select Request or Session or Identity<br><br>**Request**: If this option is selected, the Integration Server picks the value pairs from the client's request during run time and forwards the same to the back-end.User has the option to configure the default value. This default value is taken if the request does not have the header.<br><br>**Session**: If this option is selected, the value of header is picked from session context based on the user configuration.<br><br>**Identity**: If this is selected, you can filter the request parameters based on the response from the identity provider. For more details to configure identity filters, refer to [Enhanced Identity Filters - Integration Services](Identity_Filters_Integration.md#enhanced-identity-filters-integration-services).<br><br>**_Note:_** The field is set to **Request**, by default.<br><br> **_Note:_** If the header value is scoped as a **Request** (or) **Session** and the same header is accessed under the <br>    **Expression** header value, then the expression must be represented as $request.header (or) $session.header.<br>    **Example**: If a header 1 value is a request and header 2 value is an expression, then the value of the expression must be $Request.header1.<br>![](Resources/Images/Integration_requestandsessionheader.png) |
| TEST VALUE | Enter a value. A test value is used for testing the service. |
| DEFAULT VALUE | Change the syntax, if required. The default value will be used if the test value is empty. |
| Description | Enter the description for the header parameter. |
        
6.  You can add pre and post processing logic to services to modify the request inputs. When you test, the services details of various stages are displayed in the service execution for better debugging. You can refer to [Test a Service Operation](Test_a_Service_Operation.md) for the steps to test a service.

### Configure Response Operation for XML
