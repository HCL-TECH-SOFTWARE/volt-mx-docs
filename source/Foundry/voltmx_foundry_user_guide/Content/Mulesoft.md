Mulesoft Adapter
----------------

MuleSoft (Anypoint Platform™) is a platform that helps app developers to design custom APIs and deploy to a Mule Enterprise Service Bus runtime (ESB). With MuleSoft integration service in Volt MX Foundry, developers can interact with more than 50 types of adapters.

To integrate a MuleSoft service in Volt MX Foundry, developers need to create a project in MuleSoft Studio, export the project to a local system, and then deploy it to Cloud Hub. On top of the project deployment, a RESTful API modeling language (RAML) file needs to be built, which defines all the API definitions in the project. A RAML file also contains the defined schemas with properties. When a user creates a project from AnyPoint API Studio with any adapter and builds a RAML file over the project, all the APIs can be used in Volt MX Foundry integration service. When a Volt MX Foundry user selects a MuleSoft adapter from Volt MX Foundry Console, based on the cloud hub portal credentials of the MuleSoft adapter, the system retrieves metadata from a RAML file and displays all APIs of a RAML file. Developers can add these APIs as operations in MuleSoft integration service in Volt MX Foundry Console.

Volt MX Foundry discovers the MuleSoft endpoints through a RAML file. Volt MX Foundry parses a RAML file and exposes all the MuleSoft endpoints through the integration service. Mobile app developers can use the configured MuleSoft integration service and access the backend systems supported by MuleSoft’s adapters.

> **_Note:_** In Volt MX Foundry Console, you can provide login credentials of MuleSoft or upload a RAML file to configure an integration service.

### Advantages

*   Developers can design custom APIs
*   Developers can use more than 50 types of connectors.

### Limitations

*   When an APIGroup is created, only one RAML file needs to be created. Multiple files are not supported.
*   Reconfiguration of apps during publish is not supported for MuleSoft.
*   The schema defined must always be in JSON format. XML schema is not supported.
*   API Gateway (On-premises / Cloud) and Mule ESB (On-premises) are not supported.

### Prerequisites

*   Log in to MuleSoft with your credentials at [https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin](https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/#/signin).
*   Download IDE of AnyPoint Studio (MuleSoft) from [https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio](https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio).

If the JDK version is different, an unsupported class version error will appear when a service is used from a device. |
    | API Throttling | If you want to use **API throttling** in Volt MX Foundry Console, to limit the number of request calls within a minute. do the following: In the **Total Rate Limit** text box, enter a required value. This will limit the total number of requests processed by this API.In the **Rate Limit Per IP** field, enter a required value. With this value, you can limit the number of IP address requests configured in your Volt MX Foundry console in terms of Per IP Rate Limit. *   To override throttling from Volt MX Foundry App Services Console, refer to [Override API Throttling Configuration](API_Throttling_Override.md#override-api-throttling-configuration). > **_Note:_** In case of On-premises, the number of nodes in a clustered environment is set by configuring the `VOLTMX_SERVER_NUMBER_OF_NODES` property in the Admin Console. This property indicates the number of nodes configured in the cluster. The default value is 1. Refer to [The Runtime Configuration tab on the Settings screen of App Services](../../../Foundry/vmf_integrationservice_admin_console_userguide/Content/Runtime_Configuration.md). The total limit set in the Volt MX Foundry Console will be divided by the number of configured nodes. For example, a throttling limit of 600 requests/minute with three nodes will be calculated to be 200 requests/minute per node. This is applicable for Cloud and On-premises. |
