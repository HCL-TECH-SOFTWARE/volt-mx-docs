Invoking an Object Service
--------------------------

Volt MX  provides you with programmatic access to backend data. Access is gained in two steps:

1.  Acquire a current instance of your object service.
2.  Use the object service instance together with data objects to communicate as needed with your backend.

To know more about how to acquire a current instance of your object service, refer to [Creating an ObjectService Object](getObjectService_Method.md) documentation.

To know more about the methods that act on the Volt MX Foundry endpoint directly, refer to [ObjectService Class](ObjectService_Class.md) documentation.

To know more about the usage of the data transfer objects, refer to [DataObject Class](DataObject_Class.md) documentation.

> **_Note:_** The .NET SDK does not support Offline Object Services.
