SOAP
----

To create the service definitions for an external data source providing SOAP interface, use the SOAP Service. You need to have a WSDL URL or file to create the service definition. For example, we will use a WSDL URL of a weather application that has a `GetCityWeatherByZip` service and will provide appropriate configurations for the Service Definition.

### Configure SOAP End-point Adapter

To configure a SOAP service in [Integration service definition](ConfigureIntegrationService.md) tab, follow these steps:

1.  In the **Name** field, provide a unique name for your service.
2.  From the **Service Type** list, select _SOAP_.

### Configure Request Operation for SOAP

Integration services accept only `form-url-encoded` inputs for all input parameters provided in service input parameters (request input).

You can perform the following actions in **Request Input** tab:

1.  Click **Add Parameter**  to add an entry (if the entries for input and the output tabs does not exist).
2.  To make duplicate entries, select the check box for the entry, click **Copy** and **Paste**.
3.  To delete an entry, select the check box for an entry and click **Delete** .
4.  Under the **Body** tab, perform the following actions:
    1.  To forward the body of the client's request to backend as it is, select the **Enable pass-through input body** check box. For more details on API Proxy service, refer to [](#APIProxyCheckBox)[How to Enable Pass-through Proxy for Operations](API_Proxy_Adapter.md#how-to-enable-pass-through-proxy-for-operations).
        
        ![](Resources/Images/APIProxyBody_534x172.png)
        
    2.  To configure parameters in the clients body, do the following:
        
        | Field | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        | Name | Enter the name for the request input parameter. |
        | Value | Three different options are available in Volt MX Foundry under **VALUE** during configuration of any operation. When you start editing this field, dependent identity services are auto populated. These options primarily determine the source of the value of the header**.**
        Select request or session or Identity        
        **Request**: If this option is selected, the Integration Server picks the value pairs from the client's request during run time and forwards the same to the back-end.User has the option to configure the default value. This default value is taken if the request does not have the header.**Session**: If this option is selected, the value of header is picked from session context based on the user configuration.**Identity**: If this option is selected, you can filter the request parameters based on the response from the identity provider. For more details to configure identity filters, refer to [Enhanced Identity Filters - Integration Services](Identity_Filters_Integration.md).
        
        > **_Note:_** The field is set to **Request**, by default. |
        | TEST VALUE | Enter a value. A test value is used for testing the service. |
        | DEFAULT VALUE | Enter the value, if required. The default value will be used if the test value is empty. |
        | Scope | Select request or session. This field is set to **Request**, by default. |
        | Encode | Select the checkbox to enable an input parameter to be encoded. For example, the name New York Times would be encoded as _New_York_Times_  when the encoding is set to True. The encoding must also adhere the HTML URL encoding standards. |
        | Description | Enter the description for the request. |
        
5.  Click the **Header** tab to provide the following customer headers, perform the following actions:
    
    ![](Resources/Images/APIProxyHeader_559x109.png)
    
    You must provide the custom HTTP headers based on the operation. For example, post or get.
    
    1.  To forward headers of the client's request to backend as it is, select the **Enable pass-through input header** check box. For more details on API Proxy service, refer to [How to Enable Pass-through Proxy for Operations](#APIProxyCheckBox).
    2.  To configure parameters in the client's header, do the following:
        
        | Field | Description |
        | --- | --- |
        | Name | Provide custom HTTP headers required by the external source. |
        | Value | Three different options are available in Volt MX Foundry under **VALUE** during configuration of any operation. When you start editing this field, dependent identity services are auto populated. These options primarily determine the source of the value of the header**.**
        Select request or session or Identity.
        
        **Request**: If this option is selected, the Integration Server picks the value pairs from the client's request during run time and forwards the same to the back-end.User has the option to configure the default value. This default value is taken if the request does not have the header.**Session**: If this option is selected, the value of header is picked from session context based on the user configuration.**Identity**: If this option is selected, you can filter the request parameters based on the response from the identity provider. For more details to configure identity filters, refer to [Enhanced Identity Filters - Integration Services](Identity_Filters_Integration.md).
        
        > **_Note:_** The field is set to **Request**, by default.> **_Note:_** If the header value is scoped as a **Request** (or) **Session** and the same header is accessed under the **Expression** header value, then the expression must be represented as $request.header (or) $session.header.**Example**: If a header 1 value is a request and header 2 value is an expression, then the value of the expression must be $Request.header1.![](Resources/Images/Integration_requestandsessionheader.png) |
        | TEST VALUE | Enter a value. A test value is used for testing the service. |
        | DEFAULT VALUE | Change the syntax, if required. The default value will be used if the test value is empty. |
        | Description | Enter the description for the header. |
        
6.  You can add pre and post processing logic to services to modify the request inputs. When you test, the services details of various stages are displayed in the service execution for better debugging. You can refer to [Test a Service Operation](Test_a_Service_Operation.md) for the steps to test a service.

### Configure Response Operation for SOAP

Click the **Response Output** tab to configure the fields of the table for displaying the data.

![](Resources/Images/APIProxyOutput_589x147.png)

> **_Note:_** If you define parameters inside a record as the session, the session scope will not get reflected for the parameters.

1.  To forward the response from the backend to the client as it is, select the **Enable pass-through output body** check box. For more details on API Proxy service, refer to [How to Enable Pass-through Proxy for Operations](API_Proxy_Adapter.md#how-to-enable-pass-through-proxy-for-operations).
2.  You can create a desired output based on the back-end response by using XPath. So that the extracted output can be sent to the client app. You can create an XPath **manually**.
    
    The following steps details XPath generation manually:
    
    1.  Click **Add Parameter** to add new row.
    2.  Click the **Tree** button in the **Backend Response** tab.
        
        This displays the backend response in a tree structure format.
        
    3.  Click the node for which you want to create XPath.
        
        The XPath for that node is displayed at the bottom of the Tree structure.
        
        ![](Resources/Images/NodePath_235x192.png)
        
    4.  Enter that XPath in the row that you have created.
        
        For more details, refer [XPath in Volt MX Foundry](XPath.md).
        
3.  To configure parameters in the response, enter the values for required fields such as name, path, scope, data type, collection ID, record ID, format and format value.
    
      
    | ID | Path |
    | --- | --- |
    | State | //GetCityWeatherByZIPResponse/GetCityWeatherByZIPResult /State |
    | City | //GetCityWeatherByZIPResponse/GetCityWeatherByZIPResult /City |
    | Temperature | //GetCityWeatherByZIPResponse/GetCityWeatherByZIPResult / |
    | Humidity | //GetCityWeatherByZIPResponse/GetCityWeatherByZIPResult /RelativeHumidity |
    | Wind | //GetCityWeatherByZIPResponse/GetCityWeatherByZIPResult /Wind |
    

> **_Important:_** If the back-end for a SOAP service provides the date in a specific format and you want send the date in a different format to a device, you can configure the data format and FormatValue ( syntax : `inputDateFormat~outputDateFormat`) in the response tab.  
  
For example, if a back-end sends the date as `Thu, 07 Sep 2017 07:03:00 GMT` and you want convert it to `2017-09-07T07:03:00.000+0000`, then set the format value as `EEE, dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss z~yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss.SSSZ`.  
  
![](Resources/Images/dateformat_566x108.png)  
  
For more details on the syntax of the date formats, refer [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.html](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/text/SimpleDateFormat.md)

> **_Note:_** When you enable Pass-through proxy flags, you will notice that you cannot configure request input, headers, and response out parameters for this operation.

1.  To validate the operation details, click **Save and Test**. For more details, refer to [Test a Service Operation](Test_a_Service_Operation.md).
2.  Click **SAVE OPERATION** to save the changes. To use an existing integration service, refer to [How to Use an Existing Integration Service](Manage_Existing_Integration_Services_1.md#how-to-use-an-existing-integration-service).
