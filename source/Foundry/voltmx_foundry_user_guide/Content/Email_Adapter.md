## Email Adapter

An Email Integration Service empowers a user to send emails (like notification, status mails) from the client app. You can also know the status of the email which was sent before through Email service. The email requests are sent to the Volt MX Foundry server which in-turn redirects them to the Volt MX Engagement server.

While configuring an Email service, you can pass the email ID, subject , message and even attachments as input parameters based on which the email will be delivered to the respective recipients. However, the client app user can configure the body of the email from the client app or any design time environment.

Perform the following steps to configure an Email Service:

- Configure a Service Definition for Email Service.
- Configure Operations for the Service definition.

> **_Note:_** This is a static adapter and the default configurations that appear while configuring the operations are sufficient to get the required output from the service. You can leave the remaining fields as is.

### Configure a Service Definition

To configure the Email Adapter in the **[Integration service definition](ConfigureIntegrationService.md)**tab, follow these steps:

1.  In the **Name** field, provide a unique name for your service.
2.  From the **Service Type** list, select _Email_.
3.  In the **Authentication** section, the Use Existing Identity Provider list displays the existing Identity services available in the Foundry App. Select an Identity Service from the list. This will add a security layer onto your Email service. If you select an Identity Service, you must provide appropriate login details to send an email from the client app.
4.  <details close="" markdown="block"><summary>
    The Advanced section contains the following additional configurations. You can configure them if required:

    <p>To specify dependent JAR, select the JAR containing preprocessor or postprocessor libraries from the drop-down list, or click <b>Upload New</b> to browse the JAR file from your local system. This step allows you to further filter the data sent to the back end.</p>
    <blockquote><em><b>Important:</b></em> Make sure that you upload a custom JAR file that is built on the same JDK version used for installing Volt MX Foundry Integration.<br/><br/>For example, if the JDK version on the machine where Volt MX Foundry Integration is installed is 1.6, you must use the same JDK version to build your custom jar files. If the JDK version is different, an unsupported class version error will appear when a service is used from a device.</blockquote>

> **_Note:_** All options in the Advanced section are optional.

5. In the **Description** field, provide a suitable description for the service.

6. Click **Save** or **Save and Add Operation** to save your service definition.

### Configure Operations for the Service definition

1.  Click **Save and Add Operation** in your service definition page to save your service definition and display the New Operation tab for adding operations.  
    OR  
    Click Add Operation to add a new operation or from the tree in the left pane, click Add > Add New Operation.
2.  In **Operations List** tab, select the required operation and click **Add Operation**. A new operation is created and listed in the Operations List tab with Email_Operations as default prefix. The operations available are:
    - sendEmail - You can use this operation to configure an email template which will be used by the client app to send emails.
    - getEmailStatus - You can use this operation to know the status of the emails that were sent.
3.  Select the new operation that was added to configure the operation. Refer to the following sections to know more about the configurations you can do for each operation.

#### Configure Operations

In the sendEmail operation you can configure the details like Message, Attachments, and more. The details defined here act as the template for the email.

Perform following steps to configure a sendEmail or getEmailStatus operation:

- Click the required operation from the operations list. The operation details page appears.
- Provide the following information in the details page:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Name</td>
<td>The operation name appears in the Name field. You can modify the name, if required.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Operation Security Level</td>
<td>
<p>It specifies how a client must authenticate to invoke this operation.</p>
<details close="" markdown="block"><summary>
Select one of the following security operations in the Operation Security Level field.</summary>
<ul>
<li><b>Authenticated App User</b> – It restricts the access to clients who have successfully authenticated using an Identity Service associated with the app.</li>
<li><b>Anonymous App User</b> – It allows the access from trusted clients that have the required App Key and App Secret. Authentication through an Identity Service is not required.</li>
<li><b>Public</b> – It allows any client to invoke this operation without any authentication. This setting does not provide any security to invoke this operation and you should avoid this authentication type if possible.</li>
<li><b>Private</b> – It blocks the access to this operation from any external client. It allows invocation either from an Orchestration/Object Service, or from the custom code in the same run-time environment.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<blockquote>
<em><b>Note:</b></em> The field is set to Authenticated App User, by default.

### Request Input Parameters

In the Request Input tab, you can configure the parameters like To, CC, Message, Attachments and more which are required to send an email. The details defined here act as the template for the email. You can define the value of each parameter here directly, or provide the information of the source from where the information can be retrieved.

You can define the Body and Header related input parameters from the Request Input tab. By default, the Body tab is selected. You can do the following to configure the input parameters in the Body tab:

<table>
<tr>
<th>Field</th>
<th>Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Name</td>
<td>The name for the request input parameter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Value</td>
<td>
<p>The options available in the Value list determine the source from where the value of the input parameter must be retrieved.</p>
<details close="" markdown="block"><summary>Select request or session or Identity.</summary>
<ul>
<li><b>Request</b> – It denotes that the value for the input parameter is available in the request received from the client app (device request). The default value will be honored if the request does not have the value. The Test value is honored only when you test the service from Foundry Console.</li>
<li><b>Session</b> – If you select Session, the value of the input parameter will be picked up from session context. The Default and Test value fields are disabled.</li>
<li><b>Constant</b> –Select Constant if you want to define the value for the input parameter in the Volt MX Foundry console directly.</li>
<li><b>Identity</b> – Select Identity if you want to retrieve the request input parameters from the identity provider response attributes. For example - If an identity provider responds with a profile that has userid as one of its attributes after a successful login , please use ‘profile.userid’ as value to pass it as request parameter to the backend. This will help to filter the response based on the value mentioned in ‘userid’. For more details to configure identity filters, refer to <a href="Identity_Filters_Integration.html">Enhanced Identity Filters - Integration Services.</a></li>
