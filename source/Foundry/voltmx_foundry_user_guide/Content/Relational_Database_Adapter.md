                               


Relational Database Adapter
---------------------------

With Volt MX Foundry database adapter, you can connect to your own database as an endpoint. After you configure the database adapter in Volt MX Foundry Console, you can perform create, read, update, and delete (CRUD and Binary CRUD) operations on data in the tables and invoke stored procedures, functions, and views.

For example, banks maintain a store of users and their details. With Volt MX Foundry database adapter, banks can connect to their own databases and manage customers data.

### Advantages of Volt MX Foundry Database adapter

**Following are the advantages of using Volt MX Foundry Database Adapter:**

*   Admins can connect to the given database.
*   Admins can manage the databases using CRUD operations.
*   When an admin is creating CRUD operations, the admin can access the configured schema.
*   Data types: All major data types are supported.
*   Binary Support is available in Database Adapter with Range header.
    
*   Volt MX supports eight ODATA parameters for the read operation such as `$filter, $orderby, $top, $skip` , `$select,$expand`, `$batchsize`, and `$batchid`.
    
    > **_Note:_** From V8 SP4 FP2 onwards, Volt MX supports $batchsize and $batchid for MySQL database.
    
    > **_Note:_** You must provide the required batch size to the **$batchsize** parameter.
    
    > **_Note:_** If you set **$batchsize** in the first batch call, the response of the batch generates details for the **nextBatchId** and **hasMoreRecords**. If the **hasMoreRecords** is set to **true** in the response, for the second batch call onwards, you must specify the **$batchid** with the value of **nextBatchId**. It indicates that there are more records to be downloaded in the next batch.
    
*   Volt MX supports ODATA parameter `$filter` for the Delete operation.
    
*   Volt MX supports ODATA Methods: substringof and indexof. For more information, refer to [Support for ODATA Methods (substringof and indexof)](Support_for_OData_Methods.md).
*   You can execute custom SQL queries if you want to operate on multiple tables through single operation like Joins.

#### Configure Database End-point Adapter

**To configure the Database Adapter in the [Integration service definition](ConfigureIntegrationService.md) tab, follow these steps:**

1.  In the **Name** field, provide a unique name for your service.
2.  From the **Service Type** list, select _Database_.
    
    If you select **Database**, the **Database Type, Database Connection URL**,and other details are displayed.
    
    > **_Note:_** XML is selected, by default.
    
3.  Provide the following details in the Connection Parameters section to create a Database Adapter.  
    ![](Resources/Images/rdbms.PNG)
    
    | Field Name | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Database | Type the database driver class details manually in the box or select the database type from the database list. If you select the database type from the database list, the driver class details of the selected database will be filled automatically in the field.<br><br> The database driver class for each database type is as follows:<br><br>MySQL: com.mysql.jdbc.Driver<br><br>PostgreSQL: org.postgresql.Driver<br><br>SQL Server: com.microsoft.sqlserver.jdbc.SQLServerDriver<br><br>Oracle: oracle.jdbc.OracleDriver |
    | Database Connection URL | Type the connection URL in the format given in the help text. The help text in the box changes based on the selected database driver class. You can also copy and paste the connection URL format by clicking the help icon at Database Connection URL, and make the required changes to format. The format of the connection URL is <br><br>`jdbc:<type of Database>://<ip_address>:<port>`<br><br>The connection URL of the supported database types are as follows:Oracle:<br><br> `jdbc:oracle:thin:@10.10.1.192:8081:sid`<br><br>MySQL: `jdbc:mysql://10.10.1.192:8081`<br><br>SQL Server:`jdbc:sqlserver://10.10.1.190:8081`PostgreSQL: `jdbc:postgresql://10.10.1.192:8081` |
    | User ID | Type the user ID for the connection URL. |
    | Password | Type the password for the user ID which you have entered. |
    | Advanced Settings | Specify the advanced settings like Soft Delete Flag and Autogenerated fields. <br><br>{'softdeleteflag':'<columnName>', 'softdeleteactivevalue':<active-value>, 'softdeleteinactivevalue':<inactive-value>, 'AutogeneratedFields': {'TableName': ['Field1Name','field2Name'...] } {"issoftdeletedefault ": "false","lastupdatetimestamp": "<columnname>"}<br><br> **_Note:_** When the **lastupdatetimestamp** is set, the RDBMS adapter identifies this column as the ChangeTrackingColumn to track delta/updated records. All the objects in the given Object Service must have the same ChangeTracking column name.To soft delete a record - 'softdeleteflag':'<columnName>.<br><br> **_Note:_** To soft delete a column mention the softdelete column name. Ensure all the tables have the same softdelete column name.Specify the active/inactive values for softdelete column by setting -. {'softdeleteactivevalue':<active-value>, 'softdeleteinactivevalue':<inactive-value> }To specify the autogenerated fields - `''AutogeneratedFields': {'TableName': ['Field1Name','field2Name'...] }}`<br><br>To turn off the default behavior of soft delete set - `{"issoftdeletedefault ": "false"}.` |
    | Max Pool Size | Specify maximum number of connections in the connection pool. |
    | Connection Timeout (ms) | Type the connection timeout in milliseconds. |
    
4.  Click **Test Connections** if you want to check the database connection. If the entered details are correct, the system displays the following message: Valid Database connection details.
5.  If your database is configured with a proxy server, you must select an **environment**and then click **Test Connection** to test the database connectivity. The environment should be `=> V8.3`.  
    For example, you have the Volt MX Foundry Console installed on one machine, and the Runtime and Database servers installed on another machine. When you create an integration service of type Relational Database, the Console must be established with a VPN connection to the RDBMS server. So that, when you test the Database connection, the test case will be successful. You can do this by selecting the correct environment for your Runtime Server which will ensure a VPN connection between the Console and the Runtime Server and test the database.  
    If the entered details are correct, the system displays the following message: Valid Database connection details.
  
6. **For additional configuration of your service definition, provide the following details in the Advanced section.** 
    
      | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Custom Code | To specify a JAR associated to the service, select one from the **Select Existing JAR** drop-down menu or click **Upload New** to add a new JAR file. Make sure that you upload a custom JAR file that is built on the same JDK version used for installing Volt MX Foundry Integration. |
    | API Throttling | If you want to use **API throttling** in Volt MX Foundry Console, to limit the number of request calls within a minute. do the following:
    In the **Total Rate Limit** text box, enter a required value. This will limit the total number of requests processed by this API.In the **Rate Limit Per IP** field, enter a required value. With this value, you can limit the number of IP address requests configured in your Volt MX Foundry console in terms of Per IP Rate Limit.

#### Create SQL Custom Query

If you want to write your own SQL query in the operation, do the following:

*   From the schema list, expand the required schema > CustomQueries.  
    ![](Resources/Images/sql-query_615x326.png)
*   Click Add Operation. A new operation named <schema>\_CustomQuery is created by default and will be added to the operations list.

Perform the following steps to write a custom query:

> **_Note:_** Currently only MySql, SQL Server, Oracle and PostgreSQL are supported.

*   From the operations list, click <schema>\_CustomQuery. <schema>\_CustomQuery is a default name given to the custom query operation, and it is advised to rename the operation name immediately after you create it. Expand the operation.
*   Provide the details in the Operation tab as mentioned earlier.
*   To write the custom query, expand the **Custom Query** section. This section contains the read only list of tables and field names in the left pane, and a SQL statement box in the right pane.  
    ![](Resources/Images/sql-query2.PNG)
*   In the right pane, write the required SQL query.

*   To include any input parameters in statement, mark them with @. For example, @inputparam1. Here is the sample code for it.
    <figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-voltmx" data-lang="voltmx">{
    Select * from VOLTMXUNITTESTDATABASE.products where LASTUPDATETIME > @timestamp and SOFTDELETEFLAG = @boolean limit 100;
    }</code></pre></figure>

    
    > **_Important:_** Make sure that you always provide a limit in the query to prevent server overload.
    

*   Create the corresponding input parameter in the Request Input section.
*   If you want to define any output parameters, mention the same in the Response Output section.  
    
    > **_Note:_** If there are no output parameters mentioned, then you will get the query result set as is from the adapter.
    

*   Click Save and Fetch Response to view the response from the database based on the SQL statement written.

> **_Important:_** If any error occurs in the database due to the SQL query, Volt MX Foundry will return the same error message which it receives from the database. If the error message contains any sensitive information, it is the responsibility of the developer to handle the sensitive information and display a generic error message.  

**Limitations**

*   You can write only one query in an operation.
*   For now, this feature supports only Select query. Support for Create, Update, and Delete will be available in later releases.
*   Record and Collection data types are not supported for a custom query.
*   Blob is not supported, so it is the application developer's responsibility to specify the columns (excluding blob/binary) in Select statement or to define the output response to exclude blob.

### Database Adapter Limitations

**Following are the limitations to use the Volt MX Foundry Database Adapter:**

*   Currently Volt MX Foundry database adapter supports MySQL, Oracle, MS SQL, and PostgreSQL databases.
*   Table Valued MSSQL server functions are not supported from Volt MX Database adapter
    
*   Execution of SQL commands using database adapter is not supported - for example, insert, select, and alter.
*   Using the database adapter:
    *   An admin can only alter the data in tables - Data Manipulation Language (DML).  
        
    *   An admin cannot alter the structure of the table - Data Definition Language (DDL).  
        For example, an admin cannot add a column in the table.
*   Any CRUD operation can be performed on only one record at a time based on Primary Key.
    
*   For related tables, you can perform hierarchical Create/update/read.
    
    *   `$top` in case of Oracle DB follows the ordering imposed by the backend, unless a `$orderby` is specified.
        
    *   `$expand` on self-referenced table is not supported.
        
    *   Volt MX supports `eq`, `ne`, `lt`, `le`, `gt`, `ge`, and  `or` operators with the `$filter` ODATA parameter.
        
        *   The `$expand` fails, if any related table has binary (bolb (or) bit) columns where MySQL itself fails to convert the binary data into a valid JSON.
        *   If the child payload is higher than 1024 bytes, MySQL truncates the excess data with its default properties on `group_concat()`. To resolve the issue, you must configure a higher value than the max payload size for `group_concat_max_len` property.
        *   With the `$expand` ODATA parameter, the database adapter supports multi-level query for related tables. This is applicable for objects services as well.
            
            > **_Important:_** For Volt MX Foundry V8 SP2 or below versions, the following are the limitations with `$expand`:  
              
            \- For SQL Server, Oracle, and PostgreSQL databases, `$expand`  is limited to one level.  
              
            \- For using the `$expand` ODATA parameter, MySQL version must be 5.7.7+.  
              
            \- For SQL Server, the `$expand` with a column of type `timestamp` is not supported.  
              
            \- For PostgreSQL, the `$expand` with a column of type `Boolean` is not supported.

    *   The following are the limitations of batching:
        
        *   For Batching to work, specify the **ChangeTrackingColumn** because batching is done with respect to the ChangeTrackingColumn to track delta/updated records.
        *   $batchsize and $batchid are supported only for MySQL database.
        *   You cannot download the binary columns.
        *   The $expand along with batching, the JSONExpand is only supported.
        *   Download throws an error if there are empty record in the backend.
        *   If you want specific columns to be selected using $select, you must have the ChangeTrackingColumn in $select.
        *   You must not give **$top/$skip** pair along with the **$batchsize/$batchid** pair.
        *   For the batching to work, in the RDBMS SDO flow, add the following in the **Response Mapping**:  
              
            * `<set-param inputpath="nextBatchId" outputpath="nextBatchId"/> ` 
                  
            *   `<set-param inputpath="hasMoreRecords" outputpath="hasMoreRecords"/>`

        > **_Note:_** If you specify **$orderby**, $orderby with ChangeTrackingColumn is executed first followed by your $orderby value.
        
        > **_Note:_** The number of records downloaded can be more than the batch size. This is because the records are downloaded with a **timestamp** equal to the last record's timestamp of the current batch.
