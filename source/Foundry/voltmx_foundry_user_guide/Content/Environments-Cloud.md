Environments - Volt MX Cloud
============================

By default, at least one Cloud/Environment is configured for your Volt MX Cloud account. Environments can include at least one server or a combination of all servers, such as Volt MX Foundry Integration, Volt MX Foundry Engagement, Volt MX Foundry Sync, and Volt MX Foundry Management. You can view your clouds in the **Environments** page in Volt MX Foundry console for Cloud.

For more details on HCL AppFactory such as how to configure your first app using your source code repository, build and deploy apps, deliver apps, refer [HCL AppFactory User Guide](../../../Foundry/voltmx_appfactory_user_guide/Content/Introduction.md).

> **_Important:_**  Ensure that your environments include all required servers that are part of an app.<br>  
For example, if your environment contains only Volt MX Foundry Sync, and you try to publish an app with Volt MX Foundry Engagement, the system throws an error.

From the **Environments** (VoltMX Cloud) page, you can navigate to the existing Clouds in your account:

*   **Clouds**: Following consoles are available for each of the cloud account:
    
    *   **App Services**: For more information, refer [Appendix - App Services](Appendix_-_App_Services.md).
    *   **Log Services**: For more information, refer [Log Services](Logging_as_a_Service.md).
    *   **VoltMX Foundry Sync**: For more information, refer [VoltMX Foundry Sync](../../../Foundry/voltmx_sync_console_user_guide/Content/Homepage.md).
    *   **VoltMXFoundry Messaging**: For more information, refer [VoltMXFoundry Messaging](../../../Foundry/vms_console_user_guide/Content/Introduction_1.md).
    
    > **_Note:_** You can view all applications published to a Runtime Environment. [Refer Applications Published to a Runtime Environment](Published_Apps-Environments.md)
    

Managing Cloud Environments
---------------------------

You can manage user access to the existing clouds in the **Environments** page in Foundry console such as viewing published apps to a cloud, managing features of a cloud, renaming a cloud, and deleting a cloud.

1.  From the left pane in your Volt MX Foundry Console, click **Environments**. This displays the list of environments configured for your Volt MX Foundry Cloud account.

1.  Click the **More Options** button of an environment.
    
    > **_Note:_**  The **More Options** button in the **Environments** page is available only if you have the Admin access.

2.  Perform the following actions for a cloud environment:
    
    <table style="mc-table-style: url('Resources/TableStyles/Basic.css');width: 626px;" class="TableStyle-Basic" cellspacing="0"><colgroup><col class="TableStyle-Basic-Column-Column1" style="width: 146px;"><col class="TableStyle-Basic-Column-Column1"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Published Apps</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyD-Column1-Body1">Helps you to view the list of apps published to an environment and EAS and the runtime status of the apps. <a href="Published_Apps-Environments.html" target="_blank">Click here for more information.</a></td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Manage Access</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyD-Column1-Body1">Helps you to manage environment access for all the existing users in a particular account. <a href="ManageCouldFeatures.html" target="_blank">Click here for more information.</a></td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Rename</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyD-Column1-Body1">Helps you to rename this cloud environment.</td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyB-Column1-Body1">Delete</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyA-Column1-Body1">Helps you to delete this cloud environment.</td></tr></tbody></table>
    

Limiting the Size of Storage Services - Environments in Cloud for Starter Edition
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **Limiting space for storage service** feature enables to limit the total storage used at a tenant level (Multi-tenant) for users in Cloud environments for Volt MX Apps Server. This feature is enabled for Volt MX Foundry Starter Edition.

By default, all Cloud users in Volt MX Starter Edition are provisioned with 1 GB size limit for storage services on App Servers. So, users can use the default storage in the run-time server to deploy the resources such as Web Apps, Native Apps, Storage Objects, and Runtime Services (for custom JARS and data in DB)

The **Environments** page displays the users’ usage of storage resources for app server in the Volt MX Foundry, as follows:

*   **Storage** displays the amount of storage used and the allowed total storage limit for that environment.
*   **Last updated on** displays the last time when it was measured.
*   A user can check the latest status of the storage occupied and limit by clicking the **Refresh** button.

![](Resources/Images/Cloud-StorageLimit_705x376.png)

The following are the notification messages for space for storage services:

*   When the storage space occupied by a tenant reaches 90%, a warning notification mail will be sent.
*   When the storage space occupied by a tenant reaches 100%, an error notification mail will be sent.
*   Once the space occupied by a tenant reaches 100%, apps publish will be blocked and an error message will be sent. All create/update calls for storage services will also be blocked for the tenant.
*   If the storage space had reached 90% or 100%, then space is cleared up later, and then increased it again to reach 90% or 100%, corresponding notification mail will be sent again.

> **_Note:_** The storage limit can be increased based on user's request in case the user wants to upgrade his resources for Starter Edition. For example, A user buys SMB edition and wants to increase the limit of the storage DB, he can request Volt MX for upgrading storage size limit.
