OpenAPI (Swagger) Adapter
=========================

The OpenAPI Specification (formerly: Swagger specification) is a framework that is used to define interfaces, with which you can design, build, document, and consume REST APIs.

To configure an OpenAPI (Swagger) service in Volt MX Foundry, you need a JSON or a YAML file (with any dependent files) that contains specifications for the required APIs. The service retrieves the metadata from the imported JSON or YAML files and displays the APIs.

From V9 ServicePack 2, Volt MX Foundry supports **OpenAPI 3.0**. For more information about OpenAPI 3.0, you can refer to the following articles:

*   [A Guide to What’s New in OpenAPI 3.0](https://swagger.io/blog/news/whats-new-in-openapi-3-0/)
*   [A Visual Guide to What's New in Swagger 3.0](https://blog.readme.com/an-example-filled-guide-to-swagger-3-2/)

Configuring an OpenAPI (Swagger) End-point Adapter

Creating Operations for OpenAPI (Swagger)
-----------------------------------------

After you create a service, you can view the existing operations and also create operations on the **Operations List** tab. For an OpenAPI endpoint, the operations are the paths that are defined in the Swagger file, for example: **addPet** or **updatePet**.

To create an operation, follow these steps:

1.  From the **Service Definition** page, switch to the **Operations List** tab.  
    Alternatively, click the plus (`+`) icon on the left pane, and then click **Add New Operation**.
2.  On the **Operations List** tab, from the drop-down list, select the operations that you want to add to the service.  
    When you select a path (operation), all the corresponding fields of the operation are populated.  
    ![](Resources/Images/Swagger/Add_Operation.png)  
    
3.  After you select the operations, click **ADD OPERATION**. Foundry adds the selected operations to the **Operations List** tab.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/Swagger/operation_list.png)
    
4.  Under **Configured Operations**, click an operation to view the details of the operation.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/Swagger/Edit_Operation.png)
    
5.  Foundry displays the selected operation in the edit mode. You can configure the parameters to update the operation. For more information, refer to the following table.
    
      
    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | Specifies the name that Foundry uses to identify the operation on the console. |
    | Operation Security Level | Specifies the authentication that is required to invoke the operation. Contains the following options: **Authenticated App User** – It restricts the access to clients who have successfully authenticated using an Identity Service associated with the app. **Anonymous App User** – It allows the access from trusted clients that have the required App Key and App Secret. Authentication through an Identity Service is not required. **Public** – It allows any client to invoke this operation without any authentication. This setting does not provide any security to invoke this operation and you should avoid this authentication type if possible. **Private** - It blocks the access to this operation from any external client. It allows invocation either from an Orchestration/Object Service, or from the custom code in the same run-time environment. |
    | Description | Specifies the description of the service that is displayed on the console. |

7.  After you configure the required parameters, click **SAVE**.

### Configuring Request Parameters

The request input parameters are picked from the uploaded OpenAPI specification file. Any changes that are made to the parameters from the console are ignored.

> **_Important:_** Make sure that the input parameters are `form-url-encoded`.

To create a new parameter on the Request Input tab, follow these steps:

1.  On the **Body** tab, click **Add Parameter**. A new row is added to the table of parameters.
2.  Configure the fields (columns) for the input parameter. For more information, refer to the following table.
    
    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | Specifies a unique identifier for the parameter. The name is the key of the parameter in the request. |
    | VALUE | Specifies the source of the value of the parameter. Contains the following options.**request**The value is picked from the configuration of the request parameter. If you select **request** as the source, you need to configure the TEST VALUE and DEFAULT VALUE fields.**session**The value is picked from the session context. If you select **session** as the source, the TEST VALUE and DEFAULT VALUE fields are disabled.**constant**The value is a constant that is defined on the Foundry console. If you select **constant** as the source, you need to type a value for the parameter.**identity**The value is picked from the response that is sent by the specified identity provider. If you select identity as the source, you need to configure the **provider**, **attribute**, and **value**. For example: `sampleAuth.profile.userID` |
    | TEST VALUE | Specifies the value of the parameter that is used while testing the service. |
    | DEFAULT VALUE | Specifies the value of the parameter that is used if the test value is empty. |
    | DATA TYPE | Specifies the data type of the parameter. Contains the following options:**string**A combination of alpha-numeric and special characters. Supports all formats (including UTF-8 and UTF-16) with no maximum size limit.**boolean**A value that can be true or false.**number**An integer or a floating point number.**date**A value that contains the day, month, year, and time.**collection**A set of multiple records.**record**A set of multiple objects.> **_Note:_** The **binary** data type is not supported for operations in OpenAPI (Swagger). |
    | Record ID | Specifies the ID of the record that contains the parameter. This field is applicable for nested payloads. |
    | Collection ID | Specifies the ID of the collection that contains the parameter. This field is applicable for nested payloads. |
    | Description | Specifies the description for the request parameter. |
    
3.  After you configure all the parameters, you can validate the details by testing the service operation. For more information, refer to [Test a Service Operation](Test_a_Service_Operation.md).
    

### Configuring Response Parameters

You can view the details (such as name, scope, and data type) for the response parameters on the **Response Output** tab.

The **Restrict Parameters to OpenAPI definition** check box is selected by default. The check box specifies whether parameters are picked from the OpenAPI definition file or the Foundry console configuration.

To create a parameter based on the back-end response, follow these steps:

1.  Clear the **Restrict Parameters to OpenAPI definition** check box.
2.  From the **Select Environment** list, select a run-time environment, and then click **Save and Fetch Response**.  
    The back-end response of the service appears in the **Test** window. The **Backend Response** pane displays the nodes of the response in a **Tree** view.
3.  Point to the node that you want to add to the response output parameters, and then click **Create response**.  
    ![](Resources/Images/CreateResponse_220x114.png)  
    A new row is created on the **Response Output** tab and the details of the selected node are added to it.

To create a parameter manually, follow these steps:

1.  Clear the **Restrict Parameters to OpenAPI definition** check box.
2.  Click **Add Parameter**. A new row is added to the parameters table.
3.  Configure the fields for the parameters. For more information, refer to the following table.  
    
    | Field | Description |

    | DATA TYPE | Specifies the data type of the parameter. Contains the following options:**string**A combination of alpha-numeric and special characters. Supports all formats (including UTF-8 and UTF-16) with no maximum size limit.**boolean**A value that can be true or false.**number**An integer or a floating point number.**date**A value that contains the day, month, year, and time.**collection**A set of multiple records.**record**A set of multiple objects.> **_Note:_** The **binary** data type is not supported for operations in OpenAPI (Swagger). |
    | Record ID | Specifies the ID of the record that contains the parameter. This field is applicable for nested payloads. |
    | Collection ID | Specifies the ID of the collection that contains the parameter. This field is applicable for nested payloads. |
    | Description | Specifies the description for the request parameter. |
    
4.  After you configure all the parameters, click **SAVE OPERATION**.  
    
    > **_Note:_** If you want to test the operation, select a run-time environment from the drop-down list, and then click **SAVE AND FETCH RESPONSE**.
    

> **_Note:_** You can view the service in the Data Panel feature of Volt MX Iris. By using the Data Panel, you can link back-end data services to your application UI elements seamlessly with low-code to no code. For more information on Data Panel, click [here](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/DataPanel.md#top).

### Testing the Operation

After you create an operation and configure the request and response parameters, you can test the operation and validate the details that you configured.

To test an operation, select an environment from the **Select Environment** list, and then click **SAVE AND FETCH RESPONSE**. The result of the operation appears. For more details, refer [Test a Service Operation](Test_a_Service_Operation.md).

> **_Note:_** For Post or Put methods that contain nested payloads, you cannot test the service from the Volt MX Foundry Console. You can only send a request from the App Services Console, or from [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

Miscellaneous
-------------

### Swagger 2.0 in Volt MX Foundry

*   If the Swagger file does not specify a scheme, `HTTPS` is picked by default. If the file specifies both `HTTP` and `HTTPS` schemes, `HTTP` is picked.

### OpenAPI 3.0 in Foundry V9 ServicePack 2

*   With the OpenAPI 3.0 Specification, you can add multiple URLs to your definition and also include parameters in the URL. For more information, refer to [A Visual Guide to What's New in Swagger 3.0](https://blog.readme.com/an-example-filled-guide-to-swagger-3-2#urlstructure).
    *   While creating a service for OpenAPI 3.0 in Volt MX Foundry V9 ServicePack 2, you can select only one URL as the Server URL. If your specification file contains multiple URLs, Foundry picks the first URL by default.
    *   You can change the URL before you publish the service to the run time by reconfiguring the service before a publish. For more information, refer to [Service Reconfiguration](ServiceReconfig.md).
    *   Parameters in the URL are not supported. Make sure that you add static server URLs to your specification file.
*   Extension data is not supported as Foundry parses only one specification file. If your specification file contains references to any external files, the console displays an error.  
    For example, if your file contains the following code snippet, the console displays an error:  
```
{
    "$ref": "PayInOutExtension.json#/components/schemas/customFields"
    }
```
*   The **trace** HTTP method is not supported and the APIs that use the trace method are ignored.  
    APIs that use other HTTP methods are parsed by Foundry to create operations.
*   If the HTTP response code is not **200**, the console displays the response from the back-end server as is.
*   **OpenID Connect** (OIDC) is not supported for authentication.
*   **Callbacks**, which are used to define Webhooks, are not supported. **Links**, which are used to define the output one operation as input for another operation, are not supported. Make sure that you remove Callbacks and Links from your OpenAPI 3.0 spec before you upload it to Foundry.
*   Serialization of parameters, which includes **style** (defines the delimiter for multiple parameters) and **explode** (specifies whether objects of an array are generated as separate parameters), is not supported.
*   Foundry does not parse or validate **examples** from the specification file.
