Cloudian Adapter
================

Cloudian HyperStore is an Amazon S3 compatible object storage service that is provided by Cloudian Inc. The Cloudian service on Volt MX Foundry connects to the specified S3 bucket on a HyperStore, and also performs supported operations.

You can use the service in scenarios where you want to store the data for your app (such as archives, website data, or data lakes) on a Cloudian HyperStore.

Configure a service for Cloudian
--------------------------------

To configure a Cloudian adapter in [](Configure the Service.md)[Integration Service Definition](ConfigureIntegrationService.md#IntSD) tab, follow these steps:

1.  In the **Name** field, provide a unique name for your service.  
    When you enter the name, the name is updated for the active service under the **Services** section on the left pane.  
    
    > **_Note:_** If you have an existing service with the same name, you can select a different **Version** for the service.
    
2.  From the **Service Type** list, select _Cloudian_.
3.  Under **Connection Parameters**, provide the following details.
    
    | Fields | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Upload Type | The type of data that you want to upload to the HyperStore.This parameter is optional. |
    | Access Key | The access key ID of the Cloudian HyperStore. |
    | Access Secret | The secret access key of the Cloudian HyperStore. |
    | Backend URL | The URL of the service endpoint the Cloudian HyperStore. |
    | Region | The region code of the service endpoint. |

    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Custom code | Specifies any custom business logic that you want to use for the service and the operations. The custom business logic must be in a JAR file. To specify a JAR associated to the service, select one from the **Select Existing JAR** drop-down menu or click **Upload New** to add a new JAR file. For on-premise instances of Volt MX Foundry, make sure that the JAR file that is built on the same JDK version that is used to install Volt MX Foundry Integration. |
    | API Throttling | **API throttling** on the Volt MX Foundry Console limits the number of request calls within a minute. To use API Throttling, configure the following fields: **Total Rate Limit**: Limits the number of requests that are processed by the service **Rate Limit Per IP**: Limits the number of requests that are processed by an IP address To override throttling from the Volt MX Foundry App Services Console, refer to [Override API Throttling Configuration](API_Throttling_Override.md#override-api-throttling-configuration). |

5.  The console displays the selected operation in the edit mode. Provide the following details to configure the operation:
    
      
    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Name | The operation name appears in the **Name** field. You can edit the name based on your preference. |
    | Operation Security Level | It specifies how a client must authenticate to invoke this operation.<br/>Select one of the following security operations in the **Operation Security Level** field.<br/>**Authenticated App User** – It restricts the access to clients who have successfully authenticated using an Identity Service associated with the app. **Anonymous App User** – It allows the access from trusted clients that have the required App Key and App Secret. Authentication through an Identity Service is not required. **Public** – It allows any client to invoke this operation without any authentication. This setting does not provide any security to invoke this operation and you should avoid this authentication type if possible. **Private** - It blocks the access to this operation from any external client. It allows invocation either from an Orchestration/Object Service, or from the custom code in the same run-time environment. |
