Red Hat Process Automation Manager Adapter
------------------------------------------

Red Hat® Process Automation Manager (PAM) is an open-source business automation platform. Business enterprise users can access the centralized data repository to manage and deploy **business processes**, **cases**, and **business rules**. Refer to [Red Hat Process Automation Manager](https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhpam/overview).

The Red Hat PAM adapter in Foundry Console exposes the services and operations created using Red Hat PAM Business Central Interface.

To integrate a Red Hat PAM service in Volt MX Foundry, developers need to create a project in the Red Hat PAM and deploy it to KIE Server and then configure the Red Hat PAM adapter in Foundry Integration Services. After you publish the service, you can invoke the configured operations from the runtime server.

Red Hat PAM has primarily two components: Business Central and KIE Server:

*   **Business Central** is used for decision creation and build projects.
*   **KIE Server** is used for deploying the projects. Once the project is deployed, the configured APIs for accessing decisions/rules are hosted on the server.

### Prerequisites

*   Red Hat PAM Server is installed on the host machine.
    
*   A project with DMN created using the Red Hat Process Automation Manager is deployed to KIE Server.
    
*   For invocation of processes APIs and case APIs, a project with process definition and case definition is deployed to KIE Server.
    
*   For invocation of task APIs, process definition and case definition with human tasks in a project are deployed to KIE Server.
    
*   A user is configured with the following user roles:
    
    *   `kie-server`
    *   `rest-all`
    *   `admin`

Configuring a Red Hat PAM Adapter involves the following steps:

*   [How to Create and Configure Operations for the Red Hat PAM Adapter](#how-to-create-and-configure-operations-for-the-red-hat-pam-adapter)

### How to Configure Service Definition for Red Hat PAM Adapter

To configure a Red Hat PAM adapter in the [Integration Service Definition](ConfigureIntegrationService.md) tab, follow these steps:

1.  In the **Name** field, provide a unique name for your service. When you enter the name, the name is updated for the active service under the **Services** section in the left pane.
2.  From the **Service Type** list, select _`Red Hat PAM`_.
    
    > **_Note:_** XML is selected, by default.
    
3.  Provide the following details in the Connection Parameters section to create a Red Hat PAM Adapter.
    
    | Fields | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Version | Select the version for the service. |
    | Connection URL | Provide the base endpoint URL of the KIE Server REST API endpoint.For example :`http://{host}:{port}/kie-server/services/rest/server` |
    | **User ID** | Type the user ID for the connection URL. |
    | Password | Type the password for the user ID which you have entered. |
    
4.  In the **Authentication** section, you can select an identity provider from **Use Existing Identity Provider**. This drop-down lists the identity providers created on the Identity page. If you select any identity provider, you have to enter valid login credentials.
    
    > **_Note:_** The Authentication section is optional.
    
5.  **For additional configuration of your service definition, provide the following details in the Advanced section.** 
    
      
    | Field | Description |
    | --- | --- |
    | Custom code | To specify a JAR associated to the service, select one from the **Select Existing JAR** drop-down menu or click **Upload New** to add a new JAR file. Make sure that you upload a custom JAR file that is built on the same JDK version used for installing Volt MX Foundry Integration.<br><br>**_Important:_** Make sure that you upload a custom JAR file that is built on the same JDK version used for installing Volt MX Foundry Integration.For example, if the JDK version on the machine where Volt MX Foundry Integration is installed is 1.6, you must use the same JDK version to build your custom jar files. If the JDK version is different, an unsupported class version error will appear when a service is used from a device. |
    | API Throttling | If you want to use **API throttling** in Volt MX Foundry Console, to limit the number of request calls within a minute. do the following:<br><br>In the **Total Rate Limit** text box, enter a required value. This will limit the total number of requests processed by this API.<br><br>In the **Rate Limit Per IP** field, enter a required value. With this value, you can limit the number of IP address requests configured in your Volt MX Foundry console in terms of Per IP Rate Limit.<br><br>To override throttling from Volt MX Foundry App Services Console, refer to [Override API Throttling Configuration](API_Throttling_Override.md#override-api-throttling-configuration).<br><br>**_Note:_** In case of On-premises, the number of nodes in a clustered environment is set by configuring the `VOLTMX_SERVER_NUMBER_OF_NODES` property in the Admin Console. This property indicates the number of nodes configured in the cluster. The default value is 1. Refer to [The Runtime Configuration tab on the Settings screen of App Services](../../../Foundry/vmf_integrationservice_admin_console_userguide/Content/Runtime_Configuration.md). <br>The total limit set in the Volt MX Foundry Console will be divided by the number of configured nodes. For example, a throttling limit of 600 requests/minute with three nodes will be calculated to be 200 requests/minute per node. This is applicable for Cloud and On-premises. |
    
    > **_Note:_** All options in the Advanced section are optional.
    
6.  Enter the **Description** for the service.
7.  Click **SAVE** to save your service definition.

### How to Create and Configure Operations for the Red Hat PAM Adapter

The **Operations List** tab appears only after the service definition is saved and authentication is successful using provided connection parameters.
