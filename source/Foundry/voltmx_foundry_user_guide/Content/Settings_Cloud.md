Settings - Volt MX Cloud
========================

Using **Settings** in Volt MX Cloud, you can manage users and accounts based on your role, for example, inviting users, assigning roles to users, managing reports and environments permissions, deleting users, and exporting users.

Roles Permissions to Access Foundry Console
------------------------------------------

Roles help to users to access Foundry Console and perform certain operations. There are four types of roles Foundry including the owner, admin, member, and Dev portal.

*   **Owner**: An Owner role has access to the complete functionality of Foundry Console. An Owner has access to advanced configurations and operations such as **external auth configuration**, **MFA for account level**, and so on. An Owner is a super-set of the Admin role.
*   **Admin**: An Admin role has access to the functionality of the Foundry Console.
*   **Member**: A Member role has access to the limited functionality of Foundry Console.
*   **Dev Portal**: Lets you create a Portal for exposing APIs created using Volt MX Foundry. Developers from internal and external partner teams can access the portal created to explore and test the APIs.

Refer to the following screen-shot for more details.

Environment Permissions - Foundry Clouds
---------------------------------------

An environment can have 3 types of access permissions to users.

*   **No Access**: Users cannot access a Volt MX environment.
*   **Full Access**: Users can access a Volt MX environment, which helps to build apps, publish apps, and Admin Console.
*   **Custom Access**: The **Feature Level Access** permission is supported only for Foundry clouds. Based on these permissions set for a specific Foundry Cloud, users are privileged to access a specific set of features of Foundry accordingly.

> **_Important:_** By default, all the roles have **Full Access** to Iris, Foundry Starter, and Cloud Build environments. For the remaining environments, all the roles have **No Access** by default.

> **_Note:_** The **Custom Access** permission is supported only for Foundry Clouds.

> **_Note:_** By default, all users have access to Foundry Console to create apps.


The following table details you about the features with access level permissions of an environment:

  
| Environment Permissions - Custom Access |||
| --- | --- | --- |
|   Features in an Environment | **Feature Level Access Permissions** ||
| --- | --- | --- |
| | Disable Access | Enable Access |
| --- | --- |
| **Build Client App** – If this feature is enabled, users can view the environment configuration from Iris and build a client app that connects to the environment.<br><br>It allows a user to only have Build Client App access, if the user is only allowed to build binaries pointing to an environment, but not publish or make changes to the server from Iris or from Foundry console. This feature is very useful when developers need to build binaries pointing to a production server. However, only admins are allowed to modify the server runtime by allowing the publishing capabilities.<br><br>**_Important:_** You can build apps using Iris if you have access permissions to the **Build Client App** feature in the Cloud.<br><br> To build and publish apps, you must have access to the App Services feature in your cloud. | ![](Resources/Images/tickN_25x25.jpg) | ![](Resources/Images/Tick-Mark-04_24x24.png) |
| **App Services**: If this feature is enabled, users can build apps using Iris and publish apps as well. This is a superset of Build Client App access and provides both the build and publish capabilities.<br><br>**For example, If a developer has been given access to App Services, the developer can build and publish to the server from Iris or from Foundry console.** | ![](Resources/Images/tickN_25x25.jpg) | ![](Resources/Images/Tick-Mark-04_24x24.png) |
| **Engagement Services** – Access to the Engagement Server’s admin console associated with this environment. | ![](Resources/Images/tickN_25x25.jpg) | ![](Resources/Images/Tick-Mark-04_24x24.png) |
| **Logic Services** - Access to the Integrate Node.js Services to Foundry Applications.<br><br> Refer to [How to Integrate Node.js Services into Foundry Apps](Logic_in_Apps.md). | ![](Resources/Images/tickN_25x25.jpg) | ![](Resources/Images/Tick-Mark-04_24x24.png) |
| **Logging Console** - Access to the logs for this environment from the Log Console.<br><br> Refer to [Log Services](Logging_as_a_Service.md). | ![](Resources/Images/tickN_25x25.jpg) | ![](Resources/Images/Tick-Mark-04_24x24.png) |
| You can configure the **Environment Permissions**, as follows:<br><br> **While inviting users to Cloud: Settings** > **Users** > **Manage Users** > **INVITE** > **Environment Permissions** > **FEATURE LEVEL ACCESS**. Refer to **[Invite User to an Account](#invite-user-to-an-account)<br><br>** **While updating User Environments Access**: **Settings** > **Users** > **Manage Users** > **More Options** > **Manage Cloud Access**. This is applicable to the existing users. Refer to [Managing Cloud Access of Existing User](#managing-cloud-access-of-existing-users)<br><br> **While updating the environment users access**: **Environments** > **Clouds** > **More Options** > **Manage Access**.

Each of these features is enabled with a tick mark.![](Resources/Images/FoundryCloudFullAccess_474x51.png)Custom Access - Supports from Volt MX Foundry V9 onwards only for Volt MX Foundry Clouds.You can select all the features or specific ones of a cloud by using the **Custom Access** permission. For example: When you select **Custom Access**, all features of this cloud are enabled to the selected user by default. Each of these features is enabled with a tick mark.If you want to disable a specific feature, select that feature.![](Resources/Images/FoundryCloudCustomAccess_477x53.png)**Build Client App****App Services****Logging Console****Engagement**> **_Important:_**  If a Cloud version below V9 and if it contains legacy features such as Sync Server, these features are not displayed in the **Manage Cloud Access > FEATURE LEVEL ACCESS** section. As a result, you cannot change these features.> **_Important:_**  When you change the cloud access permissions, the cloud users must log in to Volt MX Foundry again. This is to ensure that these features are reflected in their environments.For example, Let us say there is a member user called Member1, and an admin user called admin1.The Member1 has access to features in a specific Cloud, such as Build Client App, Engagement Services, and App Services.1. Member1 logs in to Foundry Console.2. Member1 is accessing the Foundry Console and Engagement Services Console.3. At this point, Admin1 logs in to Foundry Console and removes access to Engagement Services for Member1.Here, when the Admin1 removes access to a feature for the user, the user (here Member1) should have the access only to the modified set of features in that Cloud. |
    
4.  Click **INVITE**. An invitation will be sent to the user. After the user accepts the invitation, the user is added to the users list.

10.  Click **SAVE**. Your external user authentication is configured.  
    You can configure more than one external user authentications in your account, refer to the following section.

#### Multiple External User Authentications (Logging into Foundry Console on Cloud with multiple user authentication login options)

From V9 Service Pack 2, this feature supports for configuring more than one external identity providers for Cloud Login in addition to the existing HCL Account Login details in the same Count account.  
**Use Case. Logging into Foundry Console Cloud with multiple user authentication login options.** In this case, apart from Foundry Cloud users you want to provide login access to two more different users set to the same Foundry Cloud account, for example, ContractEmployees (users with Gmail account) and the EnterpriseEmployees (user emails configured with Okta). You have configured Google and Okta identity services for External User Authentication in the same account. Here, the **Enterprise Login URL** for these three users sets should be unique.

<table style="caption-side: bottom;margin-left: 0;margin-right: auto;mc-table-style: url('Resources/TableStyles/Basic.css');width: 819px;" class="TableStyle-Basic" cellspacing="0" data-mc-conditions="Default.V9SP2GA"><colgroup><col class="TableStyle-Basic-Column-Column1"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyD-Column1-Body1">The sample screen shows multiple external user authentications configured in a Foundry account.<a class="MCPopupThumbnailLink MCPopupThumbnailHover" href="Resources/Images/MultiExternalAuthLoginslistpage.png"><img class="MCPopupThumbnail img" data-mc-width="1065" data-mc-height="488" src="Resources/Images/MultiExternalAuthLoginslistpage_thumb_0_48.png" style="mc-thumbnail: hover;border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 1px;border-left-color: ;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 1px;border-right-color: ;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 1px;border-top-color: ;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 1px;border-bottom-color: ;" tabindex=""></a></td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyD-Column1-Body1"><b>EXTERNAL LOGIN URL</b> column displays the unique login URL for all users configured in the same account</td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyD-Column1-Body1"><b>NAME</b> column displays the specified label that is displayed on the Login button for external auth login page.</td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyD-Column1-Body1"><b>DESCRIPTION</b> column displays the specified description that is displayed on the external auth login page.</td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyA-Column1-Body1"><b>CONFIGURE NEW</b> button is active to configure multiple external user authentications.</td></tr></tbody></table>

  

So, when an user from any of these groups try to access Foundry Clod using this **Enterprise Login URL**, the Login page displays all these configured external identity providers list with the message: `This <> account has been configured to required user authentication via an external identity provider`. The user needs to click one of the Login buttons to login to Foundry Console account. For Enterprise Login users to log in with HCL email account, users must click **HCL Account Login** link. The following sample screen shows details the Login page with multiple external user authentications configured in the Foundry account.
