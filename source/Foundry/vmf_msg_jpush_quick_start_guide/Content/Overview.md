Overview
========

The QuickStart guide explains how to create an account with **JPush**, configure the **Engagement** server with **JPush** credentials, and submit an ad hoc **JPush** to a user. The guide assumes that you have access to the **Engagement** server on cloud.

The document explains the following topics:

1.  Creating an account with **JPush** and creating an Android application in **JPush** console.
2.  Logging on to the **Engagement** server and configuring it with **JPush** credentials.
3.  Triggering and sending ad hoc **JPush** messages to a user (we assume that the user has already subscribed to **JPush** before the ad hoc push is triggered).
