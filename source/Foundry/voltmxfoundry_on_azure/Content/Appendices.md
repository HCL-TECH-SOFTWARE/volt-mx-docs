Appendices
==========

Prerequisite Packages
---------------------

White-list the [https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/azure-cli/](https://packages.microsoft.com/repos/azure-cli/) URL to allow the Volt MX Foundry Containers on Azure Solution to download Azure CLI.

Network Settings - Accessing Azure SQL Database
-----------------------------------------------

Communication from HCL's License servers will originate from the following HCL IP address, which should be white-listed in an organization's firewall configuration:

*   115.113.211.130

White-listing the HCL IP address enables access to the Azure SQL Database.

Configuring NAT Gateway
-----------------------

A network address translation (NAT) gateway is used to enable instances in a private subnet to connect to the internet or other AWS services, but prevent the internet from initiating a connection with those instances. For more information about NAT, see [NAT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/vpc-nat.md).

From V8 SP4 onwards, Volt MX Foundry on Azure will support the routing of private subnets through a NAT instance.

To enable NAT Gateway:

*   Set the **AZURE\_FIREWALL\_ENABLED** flag in properties file to **true**.

Azure Firewall acts as NAT Gateway. All the internet traffic from Kubernetes nodes(VMs) is routed through the NAT Gateway. Deployment of Azure Firewall will increase the overall cost. The cost for Firewall in the east US region is $1.25/hour in Azure. On a monthly basis, the cost of azure firewall deployment costs around 900$. If you do not want to configure the NAT Gateway, disable the firewall deployment by setting the **AZURE\_FIREWALL\_ENABLED** flag to **false**.

Hosting your domain with Azure DNS
----------------------------------

The Domain Name System, or DNS, is responsible for translating (or resolving) a website or service name to its IP address. Azure DNS is a hosting service for DNS domains, providing name resolution using Microsoft Azure infrastructure. By hosting your domains in Azure, you can manage your DNS records using the same credentials, APIs, tools, and billing as your other Azure services.

Follow these steps to create your first DNS zone and record using the Azure Portal:

1.  **Create a DNS Zone**
    1.  Sign in to the Azure portal.
    2.  On the Hub menu, click **Create a resource** > **Networking** > and then click **DNS zone** to open the **Create DNS zone** page.  
        ![](Resources/Images/Create_DNS_529x546.png)
    3.  On the **Create DNS zone** page enter the following values, then click **Create**:
    
      
    | Setting | Value | Details |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Name | customdomainname.com | The name of the DNS zone |
    | Subscription | \[Your subscription\] | Select a subscription to create the DNS zone in. |
    | Resource group | Create new: testresourcegroup | Create a resource group. The resource group name must be unique within the subscription you selected. |
    | Location | West US |   |
    
    > **_Note:_** The resource group refers to the location of the resource group, and has no impact on the DNS zone. The DNS zone location is always **global**, and is not shown.
    
2.  **Create a DNS Record**
    1.  Go to **DNS Zones** in the Azure portal and select **customdomainname.com** DNS zone in the list.
    2.  At the top of the **DNS zone page**, select `+ Record` set to open the **Add record set** page.
    3.  On the **Add record set** page, enter the following values, and click **OK**. In this example, you are creating a CNAME record.
    
      
    | Setting | Value | Details |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | Name | www | Name of the record. |
    | Type | CNAME | Type of DNS record you want to create. Acceptable values are A, AAAA, CNAME, MX, NS, SRV, TXT, and PTR. For more information about record types, visit [Overview of DNS zones and records](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-zones-records). |
    | TTL | 1 | Time-to-live of the DNS request. |
    | TTL unit | Hours | Measurement of time for TTL value. |
    | IP Address | Alias value | This value is the Alias that the DNS record resolves. |
    
3.  Update Name Servers  
    Once you are satisfied that your DNS zone and records have been set up correctly, you need to configure your domain name to use the Azure DNS name servers. This enables other users on the Internet to find your DNS records. The name servers for your zone are given in the Azure portal:  
    ![](Resources/Images/Name_Servers_569x374.png)  
    These name servers should be configured with the domain name registrar (where you purchased the domain name). Your registrar offers the option to set up the name servers for the domain. For more information, refer [Delegate your domain to Azure DNS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/dns/dns-domain-delegation).  
    

> **_Note:_** Currently, Azure DNS does not support purchasing of domain names. If you want to purchase domains, you need to use a third-party domain name registrar. The domains can then be hosted in Azure DNS for management of DNS records.

Generating a PFX file from PEM
------------------------------

Different platforms and devices require SSL certificates to be converted to different formats. Use the following command to generate the **.pfx** file from a **.pem** file:

```
$ openssl pkcs12 -inkey private.pem -in public.pem -export -out certificate.pfx -passout
 pass:xxxxxxxx -certfile more.crt
```

Breaking down the command:

*   **openssl** – Is the command for executing OpenSSL
*   **pkcs12** – Is the file utility for PKCS#12 files in OpenSSL
*   **\-export -out certificate.pfx** – Helps export and save the PFX file as certificate.pfx
*   **\-inkey privateKey.key** – Uses the private key file privateKey.pem as the private key to combine with the certificate.
*   **\-in infile** - Is this parameter for input filename
*   **\-passout p** - Is the output file to pass phrase source. Should be passed as pass:<password>
*   **\-certfile more.crt** – This is optional, this is if you have any additional certificates you would like to include in the PFX file.

Extracting Logs from your Application
-------------------------------------

If you want to extract logs from a container, execute the following commands from your terminal:

  
| COMMAND | LOG |
| --- | --- |
| $ kubectl config current-context | Display the current-context |
| $ kubectl config use-context \<cluster-name\> | Set the default context to the cluster-name if the current context does not point to the Volt MX Foundry cluster. |
| $ kubectl get pods | Lists all the pods |
| $ kubectl logs -f \<pod-name\> | To tail logs from a specific pod |
| $ kubectl logs pod-name > logs.txt | To extract the logs of a specific pod to local file |

Connecting to AKS nodes through Jumpbox
---------------------------------------

1.  Get the Public IP of the Jumpbox from the Azure Portal.
    
2.  Use the following SSH command to connect to the Jumpbox:
    
```
$ ssh username@publicip
```

The default username is **devops** and password is **Devops@12345**.
    
3.  To log in to Azure Kubernetes node from Jumpbox, you need to get the Private IP of the node from the Azure Portal.
    
4.  Use the private key of the public key you have provided during Volt MX Foundry installation. Copy the private key to Jumpbox. Make sure you delete the key during logout.
    
5.  Execute the following command to login to AKS node:
    
```
$ ssh -i key.pem username@privateIpOfNode
```
    
The default username is **azureuser**.
    

Log Analytics
-------------

Microsoft Azure provides OMS (Operation Management Suite) Log Analytics solution to view the application logs. If you enable the flag for installation of log analytics solution (AZURE\_LOG\_ANALYTICS\_ENABLED) in the properties file, then the Operations Management Workspace is created in the Azure Resource Group.

Follow these steps to view the application specific logs:

1.  Navigate to [http://portal.azure.com/](http://portal.azure.com/).

2.  On the home page, select the resource group in which the AKS cluster is created. You can find the resource group (AZURE\_RESOURCE\_GROUP) in the properties file which was used in the VoltMX Foundry installation.

Rolling Updates
---------------

Microsoft Azure provides rolling updates feature to update the deployment with zero downtime by incrementally updating the pod instances with new pods.

Using the rolling updates feature, you can perform the following actions:

*   Update kubernetes pod configuration.
    *   Update the properties in the deployment section.
    *   Update the `-d` parameters.
*   Increase or decrease the pod count.
*   Update the docker image of the container present in the pod.

### Prerequisites

**Following are the prerequisites to perform rolling updates:**

*   Linux machine with Ubuntu 16.04 installed.
*   Unzipped directory of the **VoltMX Foundry installation zip** (Use the same unzipped directory of the Volt MX Foundry installation which was used for the initial Volt MX Foundry setup).

> **_Note:_** You can update the following Volt MX Foundry pods using the rolling update feature:  
*   voltmx-foundry-apiportal  
*   voltmx-foundry-console  
*   voltmx-foundry-engagement  
*   voltmx-foundry-identity  
*   voltmx-foundry-integration  

### Execute Rolling Updates in Azure Kubernetes Cluster

To execute the rolling updates in Azure Kubernetes cluster, perform the following steps.

1.  Log on to the **Linux machine.**
2.  Perform the following actions in the unzipped directory of the Volt MX Foundry on Azure setup.
    1.  Provide the inputs in the properties file.
    2.  Execute the `kf_setup.sh` script.
    3.  Execute **kubectl** commands to check the latest status of pods.

> **_Note:_** Upgrade one pod at a time for smooth roll out of upgrade process.  
Modify the properties file for the specific pod you want to upgrade, and execute the script.  
Once the new pod is created, repeat the process for other pods.

#### Provide Inputs in Properties File

> **_Note:_** Use the same properties file that was used to create the cluster.

*   Make sure that all the values (`AZURE_RESOURCE_GROUP`, `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`, `SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CLIENT_ID`, `SERVICE_PRINCIPAL_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AZURE_LOCATION`, `SSH_PUBLIC_KEY, SERVER_DOMAIN_NAME`, `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY`, Azure DB service parameters, Azure Redis cache details) match with the existing cluster.
*   For Non-SSL cloud, `SERVER_DOMAIN_NAME` must be the **Domain Name** of the **Azure Application Gateway**. For example, `<random_value>.cloudapp.net`.  
    You can find the Domain Name in Azure console using the following path:  
    `Home > resource group > application gateway > Frontend public IP address`
*   For SSL Cloud, `SERVER_DOMAIN_NAME` must be the **External Domain Name**.
*   To execute the rolling update for a pod, set the values of the following parameters in the properties file:
    *   `MAX_SURGE` - The number of pods that are created in addition to the desired number of pods during rolling update. Once the roll out is complete, the number of pods are reduced to the desired number of pods. `MAX_SURGE` is set to one in the properties file, by default.  
        For example, if the number of pods is three, and maxSurge= 1, then there are at most four pods during the update process. Once the roll out is complete, the number of pods will be three.
    *   `MAX_UNAVAILABLE` - The maximum number of pods that can be unavailable during the update process. `MAX_UNAVAILABLE` is set to one in the properties file, by default.  
        For example, If the number of pods is three, and maxUnavailable=1, then there will be at least two pods in service during the update process. Once the roll out is complete, the number of pods will be three.

> **_Note:_** The values of `MAX_SURGE` and `MAX_UNAVAILABLE` must not be zero simultaneously.

#### Execute the `kf_setup.sh` Script

1.  Make sure the current directory is `/azure`.
2.  Execute the `kf_setup.sh` script using the `$bash kf_setup.sh` command.
3.  Select the installation mode of the cloud that you want to upgrade (If the setup was done in enterprise mode, then select enterprise; otherwise, select trial mode).  
    ![](Resources/Images/rolling_updates_1_600x135.png)
4.  Select the execution mode. For rolling updates, select **Update**.  
    ![](Resources/Images/rolling_updates_2_601x102.png)
5.  If a database upgrade is required, choose to execute flyway migration. Otherwise, skip the flyway migration.  
    ![](Resources/Images/rolling_updates_3_599x102.png)

#### Execute kubectl Commands to Check Latest Status of Pods

**Execute the following actions to check the latest status of the pods**

*   Open a new terminal instance on the Linux machine.
*   While the rolling update is in progress, execute the following command in the terminal to view the current state of the pod:
```
$kubectl get pods  
$kubectl get deployments
```

Wait till the desired and available counts for the specific pod are equal.

![](Resources/Images/rolling_updates_4_599x244.png)

If you want to upgrade other pods, repeat the process.

### Update kubernetes Pod Configuration

#### Modify the Properties in Deployment Section

The kubernetes rolling update allows you to update the values in the deployment object for every deployment of the Volt MX Foundry pod.

You can update the following values in the kubernetes cluster:

*   Number of Pods
*   Docker image
*   Readiness init delay
*   Liveness probe init delay

Update the values in the properties file based on your requirement. The image displays the options available to upgrade the Integration pod:

![](Resources/Images/rolling_updates_5_640x310.png)

#### Modify -d parameters for the Pod

Perform the following actions to modify other parameter values for the pod:

*   Edit the required values in the properties file.
*   Increase the value of **readiness\_init\_delay (or)** **liveness\_init\_delay** of the pod by one second so that the kubernetes rolling update for the pod will get triggered.

> **_Note:_** The kubernetes rolling update starts only when the parameter values in the deployment object are modified. To modify the -d parameters in the **configmap** section, edit the liveness (or) readiness probe delay to perform the rolling update.

> **Note:**  
Consider a scenario where your Volt MX Foundry setup does not contain New Relic Monitoring enabled, and you obtain the license key later. You can enable new relic on your Volt MX Foundry setup by setting the following values  to true.      
*   NEW\_RELIC\_INFRA\_MONITORING\_ENABLED = true  
*   NEW\_RELIC\_APP\_PERF\_MONITORING\_ENABLED = true      
Provide the license key value in the properties file `NEW_RELIC_LICENSE_KEY = <value>`      
You must increase the value of readiness (or) liveness probe by one second for a pod to trigger the rolling update and enable the new relic agent in the pod.      
Perform the rolling update.  

### Increase (or) Decrease Pod Count

To increase the pod count, make sure that the kubernetes worker nodes (Azure VM’s) are scaled properly, and the number of pods is equal to the number of worker nodes.

For example, if you want to increase the integration pod count to three, then the number of worker nodes must be three.

#### Increasing kubernetes Worker Nodes in Azure

1.  Sign In to Microsoft Azure Console.
2.  Select the resource group in which the AKS Cluster is created.  
    ![](Resources/Images/rolling_updates_6_598x69.png)

    ![](Resources/Images/rolling_updates_7_600x132.png)

#### Increase (or) Decrease the Number of Pods

After increasing (or) decreasing the number of worker nodes (Azure VM’s), you can modify the pod count by following the given steps:

1.  Modify the node count of the pod in the properties file.  
    ![](Resources/Images/rolling_updates_8_601x290.png)
2.  Execute the `kf_setup.sh` file as described in the [earlier](#execute-the-script) section.

### Update the Docker Image of the Container inside the Pod

*   Modify the docker image in the properties file.  
    ![](Resources/Images/rolling_updates_9_600x293.png)
*   Execute the `kf_setup.sh` file as described in the [earlier](#execute-the-script) section.

Pod Anti-Affinity
-----------------

Pod anti-affinity is used to handle the creation of pods in worker nodes in Azure Kubernetes cluster for deploying a resilient application in the Kubernetes cluster. Certain rules are defined in a pod configuration which allows pod to be deployed only on a particular node when the required conditions are satisfied. No two pods of same kind will be deployed on a single node. Pod anti-affinity helps in distributing the pods across the cluster nodes and helps in creating resilient applications.

AKS Autoscaling
---------------

AKS autoscaling feature helps to scale the service in case of a spike or a drop in application traffic. Incase of a spike in traffic new pods need to be created and the cluster should create new worker nodes to deploy additional pods to serve the incoming traffic. Similarly, when there is a drop in traffic, nodes and pods need to scale down. This ability to automatically scale up or down the number of nodes in the AKS cluster helps in running an efficient and cost-effective cluster.

There are two components involved in auto scaling of AKS cluster.

*   **Cluster Autoscaler**: Scale the nodes in the cluster based on the pending pods which need to be deployed.
*   **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler**: Monitors the resource demand of pods. If a service needs more resources, the number of pods is automatically increased to meet the demand. You must give inputs of memory, CPU limit, and the min and max number of pods that can be scaled.

You can check the runtime usage of memory and CPU by using the following command:

```
"kubectl get hpa" //hpa is horizontal pod autoscaler.
```

Whenever the usage of either the memory or the CPU exceeds the limit given for that particular pod, the Horizontal Pod Autoscaler is triggered and it starts scaling up the pod.

As pod anti-affinity is implemented, multiple nodes of same component can’t be scheduled on a node to take care of fault-tolerance of deployed application.

When the traffic goes down and the memory and CPU usage falls below the threshold values, newly created pods are terminated. This also results in scaling down of newly created nodes to the minimum number of nodes specified by the user.

For the details about user inputs, refer to the [Configuration](VoltMX_Foundry_on_Azure.md#autoscaling) section.

Azure Resource Group Role Based Access Control (RBAC)
-----------------------------------------------------

The way to control access to resources using RBAC is to create role assignments.  
A role assignment is the process of binding a role definition to a user, group, or service principal at a particular scope for the purpose of granting access. You can create Role assignments using the Azure portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, Azure SDKs, or REST APIs.

The creation of Role Assignments has the following three elements:

*   **Security Principal**: An object that represents a user, group, or service principal that requests access to Azure resources.
*   **Role Definition**: A collection of permissions such as read, write, and delete. Roles can be generic, like **owner**; or specific, like **virtual machine reader**. you can either use the built-in roles or create custom roles for assigning.
*   **Scope**: A boundary that the access applies to. It can be specified at multiple levels such as management group, subscription, resource group or resource.

To create and remove role assignments, you must have Microsoft.Authorization/ roleAssignments/ \* permission. The Owner or User Access Administrator roles can grant this permission.

> **_Note:_** When planning the access control strategy, it is a best practice to grant users the least privilege to get their work done.

### Assign a Role at a Resource Group Scope

1.  In the navigation list, select Resource groups.
2.  Select a resource group.
3.  Select **Access control** (IAM) to see the current list of role assignments at the resource group scope.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/ClamAV/RBAC_1.png)
    
4.  Select **Add** to open the **Add Permissions** pane.
5.  The Add option is visible only if you have the permission to assign roles.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/ClamAV/RBAC_2_404x606.png)
    
6.  In the **Role** drop-down list, select a role such as **Virtual Machine Contributor**.
7.  In the **Select** list, select a user, group, or application. If you don't see the security principal in the list, you can type in the **Select** box to search the directory for display names, email addresses, and object identifiers.
8.  Click **Save** to assign the role.
9.  After a few moments, the security principal is assigned the role at the resource group scope.

You can use the same process to assign a role at the subscription level, management group level.

> **_Note:_** If the built-in roles do not meet the specific needs of your organization, then you can create custom roles. Just like built-in roles, you can assign custom roles to users, groups, and service principals at subscription, resource group, and resource scopes. Custom roles are stored in an Azure Active Directory (Azure AD) directory and can be shared across subscriptions. Each directory can have up to 2000 custom roles. You can create custom roles with Azure PowerShell, Azure CLI, or the REST API.

Configure the new **Rule**.

![](Resources/Images/whitelistIP.png)

Set **Deny Access (403)** to **Enabled**.
    
This determines whether all requests are rejected with a 403 Forbidden response or not.
    
You can set Deny Access (403) to the values shown in the following table:
    
| Value | Result |
| --- | --- |
| Enabled | Causes all requests that satisfy the matching criteria to be rejected with a 403 Forbidden response. |
| Disabled | Allow the origin server to determine the type of response that will be returned. |
    
> **_Note:_** It takes some time for the rule to be propagated to the CDN edge nodes. Check the status of rule in CDN Manage Portal.

VPN Reference Implementation
----------------------------

> **_Note:_** VPN Reference Implementation is documented assuming that the FortiGate Firewall is used on the On-Premise setup. If you are using any other firewall, contact your system administrator for setting up the incoming policies from Volt MX Foundry set up on Microsoft Azure Cloud.

A Site-to-Site VPN gateway connection is used to connect your on-premises network to an Azure virtual network over an IPsec or IKE (IKEv1 or IKEv2) VPN tunnel. This type of connection requires an on-premises VPN device that has an externally facing public IP address assigned to it. Follow the steps described [here](VPN_Implementation.md) to setup a site-to-site VPN.

Configure Backup and Restore for Azure File Share
-------------------------------------------------

An Azure file share is a convenient place for cloud applications to write their logs, metrics, and crash dumps. Logs can be written by the application instances via the File REST API, and developers can access them by mounting the file share on their local machine. To understand how to create a file share on Azure, refer to [Create a file share in Azure Files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/files/storage-how-to-create-file-share).

Before you back up an Azure file share, you must ensure that it is present in one of the supported [Storage Account types](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-files#limitations-for-azure-file-share-backup-during-preview).

### Configuring Backup

1.  Create a **Recovery Services Vault** in the same region as your file share.
2.  After creating a vault or if you already have a vault, open your vault’s Overview page and click **Backup**.
3.  In the **Backup Goal** menu, from **What do you want to back up?**, choose **Azure FileShare**.
4.  Click **Backup** to configure the backup of Azure FileShare to your Recovery Services vault.
    
    A **Select Storage Account** window appears. A list of all the supported **Storage Accounts** in the region where your vault exists is displayed.
    
5.  From the given list of Storage accounts, you should select an account and click **OK**.
    
    Azure searches for the storage account for file shares that can be backed up. If you have recently added your file shares and do not see them in the list, allow a little time for the file shares to appear.
    
6.  From the list of **File Shares** that appear, select one or more of the file shares you want to back up and click **OK**.
7.  After choosing your file shares, the Backup menu switches to the **Backup policy**. From this menu either select an existing backup policy, or create a new one, and then click **Enable Backup**.

After establishing a backup policy, a snapshot of the file shares will be taken at the scheduled time, and the recovery point is retained for the chosen period.

You can also create an on-demand backup of file shares. For more information on this feature, refer to [Create an on-demand backup](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/backup/backup-azure-files#create-an-on-demand-backup).

### Configuring Restore

If you need to restore an entire file share or individual files or folders from a Restore Point, do the following in the Backup Items menu.

1.  Open the **Recovery Services Vault** that contains the file share recovery points and click **Backup Items**. The list of Backup Item types appears.
2.  From the list, select **Azure Storage (Azure Files)**. The list of Azure file shares appears.
3.  From the list of **Azure file shares**, select the desired file share. The Backup Item details appears.
4.  From the Backup Item menu, choose **Restore Share** to restore an entire file share from a desired [Point-in-time](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-app-configuration/concept-point-time-snapshot).
5.  From the list of **Restore Points** that are displayed, select one. The selected restore point will be used to **Overwrite** your current file share or **Restore** it to an alternate file share in the same region.

### Create and share a File Share Snapshot

Azure Files provides the capability to take share snapshots of file shares. Share snapshots capture the share state at that point in time.

Snapshots can be of the following types, based on the operating system in which they're being captured.

*   Logical Volume Manager (LVM) snapshots for Linux systems
*   Apple File System (APFS) snapshots for MacOS
*   Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) for Windows file systems. NTFS and ReFS are examples of VSS.

The **az storage share snapshot** command must be used to create a snapshot of an existing share under the specified account.

Command

```
az storage share snapshot --name [--account-key] [--account-name] [--connection-string] [–metadata] [–quota] [--sas-token] [–subscription] [–timeout]
```

Example

```
SNAPSHOT=$(az storage share snapshot --account-name $STORAGEACCT  --account-key $STORAGEKEY  --name "myshare"  --query "snapshot" | tr -d '"')
```

### Restore from a share snapshot

The **az storage file copy start** command can be used to restore a file. Perform the following steps to restore from a share snapshot:

Delete the sample file (for example: SampleUpload.txt) that you have uploaded earlier, so you can restore it from the snapshot.
```
az storage file delete --account-name $STORAGEACCT --account-key $STORAGEKEY --share-name "myshare" --path "myDirectory/SampleUpload.txt"
```
Build the source URI for a snapshot restore.
```
URI=$(az storage account show --resource-group "myResourceGroup" --name $STORAGEACCT --query "primaryEndpoints.file" | tr -d '"')
```
```
URI=$URI"myshare/myDirectory/SampleUpload.txt?sharesnapshot="$SNAPSHOT
```
Restore SampleUpload.txt from the share snapshot.
```
az storage file copy start --account-name $STORAGEACCT --account-key $STORAGEKEY --source-uri $URI --destination-share "myshare" --destination-path "myDirectory/SampleUpload.txt"
```

Setting custom VNet and Subnet ranges
-------------------------------------

**Steps to use custom VNet and Subnet ranges for Azure Volt MX setup:**

For Azure installation, we use the `10.X.X.X/8` VNet and Subnet ranges. In a few cases where Volt MX Foundry must connect to the customer backend network which also has IP ranges in the same private address space, you can use a different private address range for Azure Volt MX installation. Perform the following steps to use a different private IP address range.

1.  Open the input properties file `<Installation Directory>/conf/enterprise.properties`.
2.  Find properties related to vnet and subnet ranges starting from the **VNET\_ADDRESS\_SPACE** property.
3.  Update all the properties to use the preferred private address range. For example: `192.168.X.X`.
4.  Also, update the **network.properties** file located under `<Installation Directory>/conf/` to use address ranges matching the custom private address range.

Features and Supported Regions
