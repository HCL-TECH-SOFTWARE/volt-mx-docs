Engagement
==========

Volt MX  Foundry Engagement Services Console includes three broad sections: **Overview**, **Engagement**, and **Settings**. The Engagement section includes **Campaign**, **Events**, **Adhoc**, **Segments**, and **Location**.

A campaign pertains to specific activities designed to promote a service. For example, a marketing campaign can include the promotion of a product through different channels (push notifications, SMS, and emails). A segment is obtained from the different condition sets based on a userâ€™s attributes. A campaign can have a number of segments to send messages to the users associated with a segment. All users associated with a segment can have common needs. Under **Adhoc**, you can configure and send push messages, email messages, SMS, and pass messages.

An event contains a message description and is sent through a channel (push notification, or email, or SMS, or pass) to the users. Under **Location**, you can select a geographic point by using latitude and longitude information and create a virtual border around that point. A notification is sent when a device enters or exits the specified border.
