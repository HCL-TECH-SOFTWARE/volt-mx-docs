============

Geo-Fence functionality enables administrators to select a geographic point using latitude and longitude information and then create a virtual boarders around the point of a given radius. When a device enters or exits a Geo-Fence boarder set by administrator, a push notification is sent to that device.

For example, an administrator can identify a restaurant, and then sends a specific notification about the restaurant to anyone who comes within a set range (for example, 100 meters) radius of that restaurant.
