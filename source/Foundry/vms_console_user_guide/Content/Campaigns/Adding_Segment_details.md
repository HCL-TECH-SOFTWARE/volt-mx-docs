======================

Based on added segments, you have to configure your campaigns by defining segment definitions that suits your campaigns.

> **_Note:_** Only published segments are displayed in the **Unassigned** group of segments.

To add a segment details, follow these steps:

1.  In the **Add Campaign** screen, scroll down until you see the **Segment Details** section.
    
    > **_Important:_** Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services does not allow you to publish any campaign without a segment.

    The **Segments Details** section contains the following details:
    

*   **Add Segments**: Helps you to add a new segment to the campaign.
*   **Condition No.**: This column displays the condition numbers that serves as a references to the added segments in the grid. You use them to define conditional logic in the **Segment Definition** area.
*   **Segment Name**: This column displays name of the added segments.
    
    > **_Note:_** Use the search bar under Segment Name column to search the segment details based on the segment names.
    
*   **Audience Members**: This column displays the total number of audiences eligible for that particular segment.
*   **Last Modified Date Stamp**: This column displays the last modified date of the segment. The Last modified time is not required when adding a campaign. However, when a user revisits the campaign, then it shows the last modified time.
*   **Remove**: Helps you to delete a segment from the grid. To delete the segment, select the check box and then click **Remove**.
*   **Segment logic buttons**: Five logic buttons can be used while applying conditional logic. They are “AND”, “OR”, “(“, ”)”, "Delete"
    
    Follow the order of operation for this conditional logic calculation:
    
    i. Do things in Brackets First.
    
    ii. Otherwise just go left to right.
    
*   Segment Definition: Conditional logic option need to provide to make the segment definition more appropriate.
