====================

You can begin a campaign to start immediately even before the targeted start date. A Campaign is completed when it periodically arrives at its set end date.

> **_Important:_** The **Execute Campaign** button appears dimmed because the campaign is not published. You have to publish the campaign to enable for push messages.  
  
When you click the **Execute Campaign** button, the system sets the campaign start date (if the campaign has been scheduled to start on post date) to current system date, and starts the campaign based on the set date.

To execute a campaign, follow these steps:

1.  In the **View Campaign** screen, click the **Execute Campaign** button.
    
    System displays **Campaign Notification**, asking if you wish to execute the Campaign before the start date.
    
2.  Click **Cancel** to close the dialog.
3.  Click **OK** to continue.
    
    The system changes the scheduled dates to current date and starts campaign for push messages.The campaign is executed and system displays the confirmation message on Campaign home screen, informing that the campaign execution is initiated successfully.
