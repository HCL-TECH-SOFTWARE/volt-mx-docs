============================

You have to add suitable pre-defined segments to your campaign so that you can configure segment definitions.

To assign or unassign segments to Campaign, follow these steps:

1.  In the **Add Campaign** screen > **Segment Details** > click the **Add Segments** button to assign or unassign segments to campaign.
    
      
    The **Add Segments(s) to Campaign** drop-down screen appears.

    > **_Note:_** More than one segments can be added to a campaign.
    
2.  Select one of the segment from the **Unassigned** group in the left, and then click right arrow button to move the segment to the **Assigned** group.
    
    > **_Note:_** You can assign or unassign all segments by clicking either **double-right arrow** button or **double-left arrow** button.
    
3.  Click the **Save** button to save the settings. The system displays the **Add Campaign** screen.
    
    The newly assigned segment is populated in the **Segment Details** grid list.
    
4.  Click the **Cancel** button to close the window without saving any settings and return to the **Add Campaign** screen.
