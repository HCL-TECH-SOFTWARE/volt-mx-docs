1.  If you select the **user** option as **Segments**, the User Information page displays the **Select Users** list view including the **Segment(s)**, and the **Segment Users** columns. There is a **Select a Segment** drop down list view to add segments at the bottom of the list view on the home page. By default, the system displays the **All Users** segment with total number of users.
