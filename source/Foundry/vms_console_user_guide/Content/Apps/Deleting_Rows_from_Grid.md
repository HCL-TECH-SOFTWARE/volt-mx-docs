You cannot delete applications, which are used in **Campaigns**, and **Events**. The status of such applications cannot be changed from **Published** to **Unpublished**.

To delete an application, follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to the **Application** page.
2.  Click the icon in the upper right corner of the app to open the drop-down menu. The drop down menu includes the **Edit**, **Publish**, and the **Delete** options.

    The system displays the **Delete App** dialog box asking if you wish to delete the application.
