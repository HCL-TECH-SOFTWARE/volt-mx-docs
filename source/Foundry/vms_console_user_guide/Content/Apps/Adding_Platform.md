                            

Adding details for Platforms
============================

Based on requirement, choose Apple, Android, or Windows platforms and enter details. You can skip other platforms by clicking **Next**. You need to configure at least one platform to save and publish the application successfully:

*   [Apple](#apple)
*   [Android](#android-platform)
*   [Windows](#windows-platform)

Apple
-----

An SSL certificate secures communication with Apple’s push notification servers. The private key resides securely on Volt MX servers, and Apple uses the public key for authentication.

1.  To configure the Apple platform, enter details for the following fields:
    
    *   **Application Mode: (Production or Development)**: By default, the application mode is set to production. Based on your requirement, select production or development.
        
        The application mode indicates the current status of the project. Push certificates are changed depending on the choice of application mode, and each mode requires a separate certificate.
        
        **Production** mode: When selected, real time certificates and associated password details are used to send push notifications. Binary (.ipa) files that will need to be directly installed on the device will need production certificate.
        
        **Development** mode: When selected, you can send push message notifications using Apple’s demo server. This will also mean that the app has be to directly compelled on the device.
        
        You can run web applications in a specific mode depending on the current state of the project. For example, if you develop an application, you run the application in the development mode; if you test an application, you run the application in the test mode; if you launch an application, you run the application in the production mode.
        
    *   **Upload iPhone Push Certificate**: Click the **Browse** button to upload the certificate for iPhone.
        
        > **Note:**          
        *   Click the [Create the Apple Push Notification Certificate (APNS)](Generating_an_Apple_Push_Notification.md) link for more details on how to generate an Apple certificate.  
        *   Click the [Renew the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS)](Renew_the_Apple_Push_Notification_Service__APNS__Certificate.md) Certificate link for more details on how to renew an Apple Certificate  
        *   While modifying an application, you can also test the certificate for validation by clicking the **Test Connectivity** button.  
                
    *   **Certificate Password**: Enter the password for iPhone.
    *   **Upload iPad Push Certificate**: By default, the **No** option is set to active. Select the **Yes** option, if you want to upload the certificate for iPad. The system displays the **Choose File** and **iPad Certificate Password** fields.
        
        ![](../Resources/Images/Overview/Apps/uploadipadpushcert.png)
        
    
    1.  Click the **Choose File** button to upload the certificate for iPad. If you select the **Yes** option and click **Next** without providing a certificate for iPad, then the system displays a warning message to provide a p12 certificate for iPad.
    2.  **iPad Certificate Password**: Enter a password for the iPad certificate.
2.  Click **Save** to save the specified details and proceed.
3.  Click **Cancel** to close the **Add New App** page.

Android Platform
----------------

**Google Cloud Messaging** for **Android (GCM)** is a service that helps you to send data from servers to Android applications on Android devices. This can be a message telling the Android application that there is new data to be fetched from the server (for example, a movie uploaded by a friend), or it can be a message containing up to 4kb of payload data (so apps like instant messaging can consume the message directly). The GCM service handles all aspects of queuing of messages and delivery to the target Android application running on the target device.

To configure Android platform, follow these steps:

### GCM Authorization Key

1.  **GCM/FCM Authorization Key**: Enter the GCM Authorization Key.
    
    > **Note:**

Windows Platform
----------------

Windows Platform window has two sections:

*   MPNS
*   WNS

![](../Resources/Images/Overview/Apps/windows_platform.png)

1.  To configure Windows platform, enter details for the following fields:
    *   **MPNS** 
        1.  **Targeted Platforms**: In the **Windows Phone 7 and Windows Phone 8** section, select appropriate check boxes to enable as targeted platforms.
            
            If secure communications is needed, the Windows push certificate can be used. This is a purchased SSL certificate, which is converted into the correct format to upload on Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services. It is not required and can be used only when secure communication is needed.
            
    *   **WNS**:
        
        Windows Secret is an associated secret key that contains strings used for authentication with Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services APIs. Windows Secret is used for authentication on the client side during registration.
        
        Windows SID is a security identifier that is a unique identifier of a user, user group, or other security principal, and cannot be changed. A security principal has a single SID for life, and all properties of the principal, including its name, are associated with the SID. The design allows a principal to be renamed (for example, from "John" to "Jane") without affecting the security attributes of objects that refer to the principal.
        
        1.  **Secret**: Enter the secret key details.
        2.  **SID**: Enter the SID details.
        3.  Click **Validate Credentials**. If credentials are valid, then the system displays the confirmation message that Windows 8 credentials are valid.
