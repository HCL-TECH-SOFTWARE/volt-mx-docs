<ul>
<li><blockquote><b><em>Note:</em></b> "tmp" directory is available inside <b>JBoss_Home</b> location.</blockquote></li>
<li>During the installation, all the live logs will be created in the "tmp" directory, with the file name prefixed as "lax-" followed by timestamp. These are the two installation log files:
<ul>
<li>lax-12347050814474460129-out.tmp</li>

</li>
<li><blockquote><b><em>Note:</em></b> These two files are important if there is any interruption to the installation, and due to which these files will not be merged into a single log file.</blockquote></li>
<li>Tailing live log files during installation:<br>
<p>To tail the live log files during installation, run the following command:</p><br>

</li>
<li>Once installation is done, these two log files will be merged and stored in the installation directory, with the file name prefixed as "Volt_MX_Foundry_Install_" followed by timestamp. <img src="../Content/Resources/Images/Installation_Logs/merged_log_files_1.png" alt="merged_log_files_1"></li>
<li>Reading log files once installation is completed:<br>
<p>To read the log files once installation is completed, run the following command:</p><br>

    \=======================================================================
    Install Components
    \------------------
    Please select Volt MX Foundry components to install.
    The Console is the administrative interface to manage your apps, environments and users.
    The Identity Services helps you to use a single gateway for all your authentication and authorization requests.
    The Integration Services helps you connect with any enterprise or third-party system to expose, transform and orchestrate your data as APIs.
    The API Developer Portal is a console that enables partner teams to discover, test and consume APIs.
    Engage your app users over sms, email and push using segmentation, location, campaigns and event driven messaging.
    A specialized component used to manage offline data synchronization between the backend system of record and the front-end app.
    Console, Identity and Integration Services are mandatory components of Volt MX Foundry.
    In a development scenario, all components can be installed on the same server. However, it is recommended to install these components on separate servers for a production environment.

    ->1- Console
      ->2- Identity Services
      ->3- Integration Services
      ->4- API Development Portal
      ->5- Engagement Services

    ENTER THE NUMBER FOR YOUR CHOICE, OR PRESS <ENTER> TO ACCEPT THE DEFAULT::

    - **Console** - To install Volt MX Foundry Console, type 1 and press **Enter**.
      The system creates the following databases: `<prefix>mfconsoledb<suffix>`, `<prefix>mfaccountsdb<suffix>`, and  `<prefix>mfreportsdb<suffix>`.
    - **Identity Services** - To install Volt MX Identity Services, type 2 and press **Enter**.
      The system creates the following database: `<prefix>idconfigdb<suffix>`.
    - **Integration Services** - To install Volt MX Foundry Integration, type 3 and press **Enter**.
      The system creates the following databases: `voltmxadmindb`  and  `mfreportsdb`.
    - **API Developer Portal** - To install developer portal, type 4 and press **Enter**.

      > **_Note:_** During installation if you have selected **API Developer Portal**, the **API Developer Portal** is created. You can directly access your [VoltMX Developer Portal](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/VoltMXDevPortal.md) in Volt MX Foundry Console.

    - **Engagement Services** - To install Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services, type 5 and press **Enter**.
      The system creates the following database: `<prefix>vpnsdb<suffix>`.

    **Reports Database**

    The reports database is used for configuring reports.

    The Installer creates the `mfreportsdb` if you choose either Console or Integration Services:

    - **Console** without Integration Services (with or without Engagement Services)
    - **Console** and **Integration Services** (with or without Engagement Services)
    - **Integration Services** without Console (with or without Engagement Services)

    Reports Database for Integration on a Separate Node:

    While installing console and integration on separate nodes, the installer prompts you to point the reports database during the integration installation.

    For example:

    You have installed only Console on one node. The installer creates these three databases such as `<>mfreportsdb<>` along with the `<>mfconsoledb<>` and `<>mfaccountsdb<>`. For example, your report database name is `voltmxmfreportsdb1`

    When you install the integration with or without one or more components (identity, or Engagement Services) on a separate node, the installer displays the **Reports Database Name** field in the **Database Details** window. If the installer prompts you to enter the existing reports db, enter the reports database name (for example, `voltmxmfreportsdb1`) in the **Database Details window > Reports Database Name** field.

    Refer to [creating a reports database, for example, **<prefix>mfreports<suffix>**](#CreatingReportsDBMN).
