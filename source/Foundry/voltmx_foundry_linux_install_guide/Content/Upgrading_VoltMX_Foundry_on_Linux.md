Upgrading Volt MX Foundry
========================

For upgrading Volt MX Foundry, please engage with support. 

Please join our [forum community](https://support.hcltechsw.com/community?id=community_forum&sys_id=1cdf6e1a1bf31898beab64e6ec4bcbae) or raise a [support case](https://support.hcltechsw.com/csm).

<!-- This section explains upgrading Volt MX Foundry Components through the installer. For an upgrade to work, the minimum installation version should be Foundry 7.x.GA / 8.4.X.GA.

> **_Important:_** Before you upgrade Foundry, refer to the [Certified and Supported Configurations](../../../Foundry/voltmxfoundry_supported_devices_os_browsers/Content/Introduction.md), and make sure that you upgrade the underlying software stack. For example, to upgrade to Foundry V9 ServicePack 1, you first need to upgrade MySQL to version 5.7.

> **_Note:_** If you are using Volt MX Foundry 6.5.X you must first upgrade to a 7.X version using the latest 7.X installer available at the [downloads archive](https://community.hclvoltmx.com/downloads/archive) page.

*   [Prerequisites for Upgrade from Foundry 7.x to Foundry 8.x](UpgradePrereqs.md):Â While upgrading Foundry 7.0/7.1 to Foundry V8.x for any selected database, you must remove the version\_rank column from the schema\_version table in the `idglobaldb` before the upgrade.
*   [Upgrading Volt MX Foundry to V9 or later](Upgrading_VoltMX_Foundry_SP1.md): You can upgrade to Volt MX Foundry V9 by providing the existing Foundry database details.
