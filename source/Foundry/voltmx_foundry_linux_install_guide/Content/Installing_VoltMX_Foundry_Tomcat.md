Introduction
------------

This installer will install a new or upgrade an existing instance of Foundry.

Volt MX  Foundry is a set of enterprise-grade mobile infrastructure services
that makes it easy to build amazing apps that integrate and support all of
your backend systems. With open, standards-based development, scalable and
secure services, and exceptional agility, enterprises can dramatically reduce
the cost and complexity of enterprise mobility projects.

To proceed with installation, please confirm that the following prerequisites
have been met -

1. Database server with admin user for installation. MySQL, MariaDB, Oracle
and MS SQL Server are the supported Database servers. MariaDB is supported for
Tomcat/JBoss only
2. Corresponding database user should exist and that user should have all
required privileges as per the documentation.
3. If you want to use your existing SSL certificate then please have the SSL
certificate mapped to the domain name you want to use.
4. If you want to install with JBoss as an option for application server, then
have the application server preconfigured. Please note that single node JBoss
is also bundled as part of the installer, in case you want to install afresh.

To change input, type 'back' to go back to the previous step.
To cancel the installation, type 'quit' at any time.

    Install Components
    ------------------
    
    Please select Volt MX Foundry components to install.
    The Console is the administrative interface to manage your apps, environments
    and users.
    The Identity Services helps you to use a single gateway for all your
    authentication and authorization requests.
    The Integration Services helps you connect with any enterprise or third-party
    system to expose, transform and orchestrate your data as APIs.
    The API Developer Portal is a console that enables partner teams to discover,
    test and consume APIs.
    Engage your app users over sms, email and push using segmentation, location,
    campaigns and event driven messaging.
    A specialized component used to manage offline data synchronization between
    the backend system of record and the front-end app.
    
     Console, Identity and Integration Services are mandatory components of
    Volt MX Foundry. In a development scenario, all components can be installed on
    the same server. However, it is recommended to install these components on
    separate servers for a production environment.
    
      ->1- Console
      ->2- Identity Services
      ->3- Integration Services
      ->4- API Developer Portal

```
    
*   **Console** - To install Volt MX Foundry Console, type 1 and press **Enter**.  
        The system creates the following databases: `<prefix>mfconsoledb<suffix>`, `<prefix>mfaccountsdb<suffix>`, and  `<prefix>mfreportsdb<suffix>`.
*   **Identity Services** - To install Volt MX Identity Services, type 2 and press **Enter**.  
        The system creates the following database: `<prefix>idconfigdb<suffix>`.
*   **Integration Services** - To install Volt MX Foundry Integration, type 3 and press **Enter**.  
        The system creates the following databases: `VoltMXadmindb`  and  `mfreportsdb`.
*   **API Developer Portal** - To install developer portal, type 4 and press **Enter**.  
        
    > **_Note:_** During installation if you have selected **API Developer Portal**, the **API Developer Portal** is created. You can directly access your [VoltMX Developer Portal](../../../Foundry/voltmx_foundry_user_guide/Content/VoltMXDevPortal.md) in Volt MX Foundry Console.
        
*   **Engagement Services** - To install Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services, type 5 and press **Enter**.  
        The system creates the following database: `<prefix>vpnsdb<suffix>`.
    
**Reports Database**
    
    The reports database is used for configuring reports.
    
    The Installer creates the `mfreportsdb` if you choose either Console or Integration Services:
    
    *   **Console** without Integration Services (with or without Engagement Services)
    *   **Console** and **Integration Services** (with or without Engagement Services)
    *   **Integration Services** without Console (with or without Engagement Services)
    
    Reports Database for Integration on a Separate Node:
    
    While installing console and integration on separate nodes, the installer prompts you to point the reports database during the integration installation.  
      
    For example:  
      
    You have installed only Console on one node. The installer creates these three databases such as `<>mfreportsdb<>` along with the `<>mfconsoledb<>` and `<>mfaccountsdb<>`. For example, your report database name is `voltmxmfreportsdb1`  
      
    When you install the integration with or without one or more components (identity, or Engagement Services ) on a separate node, the installer displays the **Reports Database Name** field in the **Database Details** window. If the installer prompts you to enter the existing reports db, enter the reports database name (for example, `voltmxmfreportsdb1`) in the **Database Details window > Reports Database Name** field.  
      
    Refer to [creating a reports database, for example, **<prefix>mfreports<suffix>**](#CreatingReportsDB).
