===================

The license activations are executed by Volt MX License Server which is hosted on Amazon's cloud service - EC2.

This part of the Volt MX Licensing Guide provides you with the information you need to activate license for Volt MX products, and is divided into the following sections. Click a sectionâ€™s link to view its contents.

*   [VoltMX Iris Enterprise](VoltMXOne_Studio_IDE.md)
*   [VoltMX Foundry](License_Activation_through_VoltMX_Server_7.2.md)

**Note:** Volt MX License Server is the preferred method for activating licenses. If you do not have access to the server, you can download the installer for a local license server from the HCL License and Download Portal ([https://hclsoftware-fno.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operations/](https://hclsoftware-fno.flexnetoperations.com/flexnet/operations/)), using your HCL Software ID.
