============================

> **_Note:_** If a user installs Volt MX Foundry Console on a partition different from the user's home directory, the user must have read/write execute permissions.

This section of the document provides you with the instructions for installing and configuring Volt MX Foundry Console.

> **_Important:_** Ensure that you have the required hardware and access to the supporting software as mentioned in the [Prerequisites](Prerequisites.md) section and performed the steps as mentioned in the Pre-installation Tasks section.

Make sure you have proper administrative rights to install Volt MX Foundry on your computer.

You also need a user where Volt MX Foundry will be installed.

The **<Install Location>** directory contains the log files documenting each invocation of the installer. To make problem identification easier, provide these log files to Volt MX when reporting an issue.

Single-Node Installation Procedure
----------------------------------

To install Volt MX Foundry Console using the installer, follow these steps:

1.  Execute the following command to switch to the user that you created.  
    
    \# su - username  

3.  Press **Enter**. You will be prompted to enter the password.
4.  Enter the password, and press **Enter**.
5.  Unzip the downloaded zip file, and go to the folder _**VoltMXFoundry\\_Installer\\_Linux**_.
6.  Start the installation by executing **./VoltMXFoundryConsoleInstaller-6.0.1.GA.bin**. Below is  the output from the installation process.
7.  Press **Enter**. The _Prerequisites_ option appears.
8.  To confirm that the prerequisites have been met and continue the installation, type 1, or type 2 to abort and perform prerequisites. The _License Agreement_ option appears.
9.  Press **Y** to accept the agreement.The _Install Components_ option appears. **Note:** The Volt MX Identity Service helps you to use a single channel for all your authentication and authorization requests. The Volt MX Foundry Console is the administrative interface. In a development scenario, these can be installed on the same box. However, it is recommended to install these components on separate boxes for production environments. 
10. Enter the number for your choice, or press **Enter** to accept the default. 
11. Press **Enter** to continue the installation. The _Install Folder_ option appears. By default, Volt MX Foundry is installed at the home directory of the user.   
12. Press **Enter** to continue the installation. The _Installation Mode_ option appears.    
13. Select your required installation mode. Standalone mode is for single node deployment, whereas domain mode is for multi node deployment in JBoss cluster.
  *To install single-node, type 1 for Standalone Mode, or press **Enter**.  
  *To install multi-node, type 2 for Domain Mode. Before installing domain mode, ensure that the JBoss cluster is configured on your install system. For more details, refer to Multi-Node Installation Procedure. If you are running JBoss in Domain node for a production setup, please procure appropriate licenses from Red Hat, Inc.    
14. If you select Standalone Mode, the _HTTP or HTTPS_ communication protocol option appears. 
  *Type 1 for HTTP or press **Enter**.
  *Type 2 for HTTPS.
15. You are prompted to enter the Hostname/IP Address and port you want to use. The default values are the IP Address of this machine and port 8080. If you chose HTTPS, you are also prompted for the HTTPS port, which is 8443 by default. If a port you choose is busy or you specify invalid values, you will be prompted to correct the relevant information.
    **NOTE:** If you want to use your existing SSL certificate for HTTPS, please have the SSL certificate mapped to the domain name you want to use. After installing Volt MX Foundry, import your SSL certificate (for example, domain.subdomain.crt) into your Foundry installer's JRE trusted certificate authority (CA) certificates file - for example, `<INSTALL_DIR>/jre/lib/security/cacerts`. If your SSL certificate is not configured, the system will display an error - for example, "peer not authenticated". For details, refer to [Troubleshoot with SSL Certificate Issues](Troubleshooting.md#Service_Provider's_Certificate_Issues).
16. If you chose HTTPS, the _SSL Configuration for HTTPS Communication_ option appears. Type 1 or press Enter if you want to create a self-signed certificate, or 2 if you will provide an SSL certificate.
17. When prompted, supply the requested certificate information.     
    **_Important:_** To add an existing SSL certificate to cacerts file, refer to [How to Add Your Existing SSL Certificate](Troubleshooting.md#ExistingSelf-signedcertificate).
    **_Note:_** The path for a self-signed certificate will be `<install folder>\keystore.jks`.
        
    2.  In the _SSL Configuration for HTTPS Communication_, if you select 2, the _SSL Certificate Details_ option appears.
