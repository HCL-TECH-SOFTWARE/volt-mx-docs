Volt MX Foundry Console Access Control Guide: Preface

# Preface

Volt MX Foundry is a Mobile Back-end as a Service (MBaaS) provider that helps developers build native and web apps for mobile. Various back-end services are easily integrated with the application irrespective of whether the application is built using JavaScript, PhoneGap, iOS, or Android frameworks.

Volt MX Foundry allows you to define the back-end to build native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and HTML5-based apps for modern browsers. Volt MX Foundry ensures that developers build mobile applications quickly by focusing on core areas and obtaining secured back-end services instantly. Volt MX Foundry has multiple features that can be used - Identity, Integration, Orchestration, Objects, Sync, and Engagement Services. These features can be accessed through a common, centralized console.

For successful authentication with users, and to access the centralized features of Volt MX Foundry, Volt MX recommends that you install the following Volt MX Foundry features on premises:

- Volt MX Foundry Identity and Console
- Volt MX Foundry Integration

Volt MX Foundry supports the following back-end services for your applications:

- Identity: This feature allows you to define the type of authentication used for granting access to your application. Volt MX Foundry supports the following authentication services: Microsoft Active Directory, Salesforce, Security Assertion Markup Language (SAML), SAP Gateway, Facebook, and Volt MX User Repository.
- Integration: This feature allows you to define various back-end services for your application. You can define the service in XML, SOAP, JSON, Java, Salesforce, and SAP Gateway.

  - Composite: Allows you to run two or more services concurrently or sequentially.
  - Looping: Allows you to run a single service in a loop until the loop ends or an exit criteria is met.
