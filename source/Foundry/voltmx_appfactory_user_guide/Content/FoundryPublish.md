--------------------

> **_Important:_** The **Publish** job is deprecated. HCL recommends using the **buildFoundryApp** job from the `Foundry/Builds` folder to achieve similar functionality. You can opt in to the **IMPORT** and **PUBLISH** options while configuring the build job to achieve the same functionality as the Publish job.

Publish job is responsible for publishing the existing Volt MX Foundry application to a specific environment.
