-------------------

The Volt MX Foundry export is used to export the existing Volt MX Foundry application to your SCM.

The export job keeps track of the application code that is exported in the previous build. If there are no changes from the previous build, the push part of the pipeline is omitted.

### Configuration  

You can build the Export job by using the **Build with Parameters** option. You can access the option by following either of these steps.

*   On the right-side of the job row, select the icon that represents Build with Parameters
*   Open the drop-down list for the **buildFoundryApp** job, and then select **Build with Parameters**
*   Open the **buildFoundryApp** job and click **Build with Parameters** on the left panel

> **_Note:_** If you donâ€™t see the option, you might not have ownership permissions to the project. You can verify whether your name is listed in the Folder Owners section of the project. The Primary owner of the project can add users as secondary owners to grant permissions to the builds.

To build the job, you need to configure the build parameters. For more information about the parameters, refer to the following sections.

### Exporting

After you configure the build parameters, you can trigger the export by clicking **BUILD**. The export process contains the following stages:

*   Prepare the build node environment
*   Export Volt MX Foundry application
*   Clone Volt MX Foundry application from Git
*   Check if there were changes
*   Configure local Git account
*   Prettify exported JSON files and move them to SCM
*   Push changes to remote storing artifacts
*   Notify on export status by email
