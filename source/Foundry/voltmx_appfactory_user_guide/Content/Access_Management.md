=======================================

Volt MX  supports external authentication on an App Factory Account. You can access the App Factory console by using your Okta credentials. By using external authentication, you can download and access the artifacts and MustHaves on your App Factory Account.

> **_Note:_**  
When external authentication is enabled for an App Factory Account, it is enabled for all the tenants of the account.

To access your **App Factory Account** by using third-party applications, follow these steps:

1.  Sign-in to the [VoltMX Foundry Console](https://manage.hclvoltmx.com/).
2.  From the **Accounts** list, select **App Factory Account**.

If Okta is enabled, a **RE-LOGIN** button appears.
