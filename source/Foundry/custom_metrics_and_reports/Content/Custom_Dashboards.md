Custom Dashboards
=================

A custom dashboard displays reports in a single and integrated view. A dashboard can include standard reports, custom reports, input controls for choosing the data in one or more frames, and custom frames that points to URLs for other content. By combining different types of related content, you can create appealing and data-rich dashboards.
