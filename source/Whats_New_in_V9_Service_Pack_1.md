The Responsive Grid Layout feature provides a quick and convenient way to create a responsive layout for apps on the Web, Mobile, and Tablet channels. VoltMX Iris has introduced the Responsive Grid layout for the [FlexForm](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/FlexForm_Properties.html#flexResponsive), [FlexContainer](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/FlexContainer_Properties.html#flexResponsive), and [FlexScrollContainer](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/FlexScrollContainer_Properties.html#flexResponsive) widgets to enable a Bootstrap-like responsive grid experience. A new property, [responsiveConfig](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/FlexContainer_Properties.html#responsiveConfig), has also been introduced for the FlexContainer widget that allows you to set the width of a container and the space between adjacent containers.
