Video Widget
============

The Video widget helps to play the video files captured using the device's camera, videos from the app resources, and from the servers/ websites by streaming data within a form. The Video widget can be added only to the FlexContainer, FlexScrollContainer, and FlexForm.

Following are a few real-time use cases of Video widget:

*   **Advertisements and Promotions:** Promotional videos are played multiple times in gaming applications, news applications, and websites.
    
*   **Greetings:** Videos like new greetings, Christmas greetings are played in a browser or an application.
    
*   **Instructional purposes:** Instructional videos are created primarily for educational purposes.
    

Widgets are normally added to your application using Volt MX Iris, but can also be added from code. For general information on using widgets in Volt MX Iris, see [Designing an Application](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Part_II_CreatingAnApplication.md) in the [Iris User Guide](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Introduction.md).

For general information on the Video widget see the [Video](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Video.md) topic in the Volt MX Iris User Guide.

This widget supports drag and drop of videos for iOS 11 on iPad.

Video Widget Basics
-------------------

### Creating a Video Using a Constructor: voltmx.ui.Video

```

var video = new voltmx.ui.Video (config);
```

Example

```
//Defining the properties for Video with source
var video1 = new voltmx.ui.Video({
    "id": "video1",
    skin: "vSkin",
    "controls": false,
    "width": "100%",
    "height": "100%",
    "zIndex": 3,
    "source": {
        "mp4": "http://www.quirksmode.org.html5/videos/big_buck_bunny.mp4",
        "mov": videofilepath,
        "rawBytes": camera1.rawBytes
    },
    "poster": null,
    "onPrepared": onPreparedCallBack
});
```

### Limitations

*   The Video Widget does not work in the DEBUG mode. It works only in the RELEASE mode.

iOS

The following are the important considerations for the iOS platform:

*   If you add Video widgets to your apps using the [voltmx.ui.video](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/voltmx.ui_functions.md#Video) API (dynamically), at least one Video widget must be added from the default library on a form in your application. If all Video widgets are added to the app using the voltmx.ui.video API, videos will not play on the app.

SPA

The following are the important considerations for the SPA platform:

*   When the form contains dockable components such as [](Form_Basic_Properties.md#headers-property)[headers](Form_Basic_Properties.md#Header)[](Form_Basic_Properties.md#Header), [footers](Form_Basic_Properties.md#Footer), or an [Appmenu](Form_Basic_Properties.md#Show), scrolling the video widget on iPhone or iPad does not scroll the form. This is due to a limitation that iPhone video controls do not respond to (custom) touch events when media controls are present.To avoid this, apply left or right margins to the either side of the video widget to enable scrolling of the form as well.
*   If you have two videos in a form, you can only play one at a time.

Supported devices and video formats for SPA platform.
