Widget Programmers' Guide

Volt MX  Iris is a powerful yet easy-to-use integrated development environment (IDE) for developing, building, testing, debugging, and deploying mobile applications for multiple platformsâ€”all from a single code base. To learn how to use Volt MX Iris, see the Volt MX Iris [User Guide](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Introduction.md).

Volt MX  Iris allows you to create applications visually by dragging widgets from the Widget Library, and dropping them onto a form or other container object, quickly creating the user interface for a mobile application. These widgets have properties that can be set in Volt MX Iris, and can also be set and modified by code you write as part of your application.

The Volt MX Iris Widget Programmers' Guide describes each widget, its properties, and how you can write JavaScript code to change properties and control the behavior of widgets within your application.

Widgets Overviews
-----------------

This section of the Volt MX Iris Widget Programmer's Guide provides general information on the use of Widgets within your Iris applications.

Widgets are visual components in Volt MX Iris that are used to build application user interfaces quickly and with a minimum of custom code. Although most widget properties can be set using the Volt MX Iris IDE, some properties need to be set and managed from custom JavaScript code. This guide describes how this is done, and lists the properties and events you will use to interact with Volt MX Iris widgets.

Widgets are small chunks of re-usable code which include graphical user-interface elements that scale gracefully depending on the power and resolution of your mobile device targets. Some widgets function as containers to hold other widgets.

VoltMXwidgets also include support for platform specific properties. These platform specific properties allow your apps to have a native look and feel on each platform.

Widgets are categorized as Containers, Basic, and Advanced based on the behavior and characteristics of the widgets.

*   **Basic Widgets**: These widgets are used for basic functions on a form. They are the most commonly used widgets in an application design. These widgets are components that act independently of the Container Widgets.
*   **Container Widgets**: These hold container, basic or advanced widgets within them.
*   **Advanced widgets**: Used to achieve advanced interaction within an application. You can use these widgets along with basic widgets to achieve a complex interaction design.
