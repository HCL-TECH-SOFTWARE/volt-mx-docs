================

The basic properties for Label widget are:

* * *


<details close markdown="block"><summary>accessibilityConfig Property</summary>

* * *

Enables you to control accessibility behavior and alternative text for the widget.

For more information on using accessibility features in your app, see the [Accessibility](../../../Iris/app_design_dev/Content/Accessibility_Overview.md) appendix in the VoltMX IrisUser Guide.

### Syntax 

```

accessibilityConfig
```

### Type

Object

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   The accessibilityConfig property is enabled for all the widgets which are supported under the Flex Layout.

> **_Note:_** From VoltMX Iris V9 SP2 GA version, you can provide i18n keys as values to all the attributes used inside the `accessibilityConfig` property. Values provided in the i18n keys take precedence over values provided in `a11yLabel`, `a11yValue`, and `a11yHint` fields.

The accessibilityConfig property is a JavaScript object which can contain the following key-value pairs.

  
| Key | Type | Description | ARIA Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a11yIndex | Integer with no floating or decimal number. | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the order in which the widgets are focused on a screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-index`, `index`, or `taborder` properties. |
| a11yLabel | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies alternate text to identify the widget. Generally the label should be the text that is displayed on the screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-labelledby` property of ARIA in HTML. > **_Note:_** For the Image widget, this parameter maps to the **alt** attribute of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yValue | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | This parameter is similar to the a11yLabel parameter. If the a11yValue is defined, the value of a11yValue is appended to the value of a11yLabel. These values are separated by a space. |
| a11yHint | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-describedby` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yHidden | Boolean | This is an optional parameter. Specifies if the widget should be ignored by assistive technology. The default option is set to _false_. This option is supported on iOS 5.0 and above, Android 4.1 and above, and SPA | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-hidden` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yARIA | Object | This is an optional parameter. For each widget, the key and value provided in this object are added as the attribute and value of the HTML tags respectively. Any values provided for attributes such as `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` using this attribute, takes precedence over values given in `a11yLabel` and `a11yHint` fields. When a widget is provided with the following key value pair or attribute using the a11yARIA object, the tabIndex of the widget is automatically appended as zero.`{"role": "main"}``aria-label` | This parameter is only available on the Desktop Web platform. |

Android limitations

*   If the results of the concatenation of a11y fields result in an empty string, then `accessibilityConfig` is ignored and the text that is on widget is read out.
*   The soft keypad does not gain accessibility focus during the right/left swipe gesture when the keypad appears.

SPA/Desktop Web limitations

*   When `accessibilityConfig` property is configured for any widget, the `tabIndex` attribute is added automatically to the `accessibilityConfig` property.
*   The behavior of accessibility depends on the Web browser, Web browser version, Voice Over Assistant, and Voice Over Assistant version.
*   Currently SPA/Desktop web applications support only a few ARIA tags. To achieve more accessibility features, use the attribute a11yARIA. The corresponding tags will be added to the DOM as per these configurations.

### Example 1

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have an accessibilityConfig property.

```
//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the accessibilityConfig Property for button widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the accessibilityConfig property for other applicable widgets.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "Label",
    "a11yValue": "Value",
    "a11yHint": "Hint"    
};
```

### Example 2

This example uses the button widget to implement internationalization in `accessibilityConfig` property, but the principle remains the same for all widgets.

```
/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Native platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString("key1")     
};  
/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Desktop Web platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString(\"key3\")"
};
```

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>anchorPoint Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the anchor point of the widget bounds rectangle using the widget's coordinate space.

### Syntax 

```

anchorPoint
```

### Type

JSObject

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The value for this property is a JavaScript dictionary object with the keys "x" and "y". The values for the "x" and "y" keys are floating-point numbers ranging from 0 to 1. All geometric manipulations to the widget occur about the specified point. For example, applying a rotation transform to a widget with the default anchor point causes the widget to rotate around its center.

The default value for this property is center ( {"x":0.5, "y":0.5} ), that represents the center of the widgets bounds rectangle. The behavior is undefined if the values are outside the range zero (0) to one (1).

### Example

```
Form1.widget1.anchorPoint = {
    "x": 0.5,
    "y": 0.5
};
```

### Platform Availability

*   iOS, Android, Windows, and SPA

* * *

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>backgroundColor Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the background color of the widget.

### Syntax 

```

backgroundColor
```

### Type

Color constant or Hexadecimal number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   The initial value of backgroundColor has to be specified explicitly. If not, Iris will not deduce the values from the existing skin and this will lead to undefined behavior.
*   Colors can be specified using a 6 digit or an 8-digit hex value with alpha position. For example, ffff65 or ffffff00.
*   When the 4-byte color format (RGBA) string is used, an alpha (A) value of 65 specifies that the color is transparent. If the value is 00, the color is opaque. The Alpha value is in percentage and must be given in the hexadecimal value for the color (100% in hexadecimal value is 65).  
    For example, red complete opaque is FF000000. Red complete transparent is FF000065. The values 0x and # are not allowed in the string.
*   A color constant is a String that is defined at the theme level. Ensure that you append the **$** symbol at the beginning of the color constant.
*   This property does not have a default value.
*   This property has more priority than (and overrides) the background property of the configured skin. Even if there is no skin configured for the widget, this property updates the skin.
*   The backgroundColor, backgroundColorTwoStepGradient, backgroundColoMultiStepGradient, and backgroundImage properties are mutually exclusive. The property that was set most recently is given higher priority over other properties.

### Example

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have the backgroundColor property.

```
Form1.btn1.backgroundColor = "ea5075";

```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>blur Property</summary>

* * *

You can enable or disable a blur-effect for a widget(for example, a FlexContainer) by making use of a constructor-level property, called **blur**. The **blur** property accepts a dictionary that contains the following keys: enabled, value and style. You must specify an appropriate value for the dictionary keys, otherwise the property will not be valid.

### Syntax 

```

blur
```

### Input Parameters

*   _enabled_: Accepts a Boolean value that basically decides whether to enable or disable the blur-effect for the widget. This is a mandatory attribute.
*   _value_: Level of the blur-effect that needs to be set for the widget. It should ideally be between 0 to 100. If the level is set as 0 no blur is set, even when the enabled property is set as true. This is a mandatory attribute. Even when the _enabled_ attribute is set as false, you need to specify a numerical value to this attribute.
    
*   _style_: Specifies the style in which the blur property can be applied to a widget. This is an optional parameter specific to iOS. The default value of this parameter is constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_LIGHT. You can specify any of the following values to this parameter:  
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_NONE
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_EXTRALIGHT
        
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_LIGHT (default)
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_DARK
        
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_REGULAR
        
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_PROMINENT
        

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   If you set _enabled_ as true, the blur-effect for the widget is enabled.
*   If you set _enabled_ as false, the blur-effect for the widget is disabled.
*   If you specify _value_ as less than 0, the value is taken as 0.
    
*   If you specify _value_ as greater than 100, the value is taken as 100.

### Limitations

*   For Android:
    *   If a FlexContainer or a FlexScrollContainer contains a Map widget, the blur-effect is not applied to the map.
        
    *   If a FlexContainer or a FlexScrollContainer contains a Browser or Video widget, the blur-effect is applied but does not get updated. For example, when the video starts playing, the new rendered frame does not get displayed with the blur-effect.
        
    *   Even if you apply 100% blur for widgets that display any text( such as Label or Calendar widgets), the text on these widgets is not blurred. This is a Native Android limitation. To generate the blur effect for the text, apply a skin with darker background to the Label or Calendar widget. This is true even when the widgets are placed in a FlexContainer with blur effect and the widgets do not have a skin.
    *   Blur effect will not work on widgets added inside BOX containers.

### Example 1

To dynamically set the blur-effect for any widget, such as a FlexContainer, use the following code.

```
//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the blur property for FlexContainer widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the 
blur property for other applicable widgets.*/

Form1.myFlexContainer.blur = {
    "enabled": true,
    "value": 60
};

```

### Example 2

To dynamically set the blur-effect for any widget, such as a FlexContainer in iOS, use the following code.

```
Form1.widget1.blur = {
    "enabled": true,
    "value": 60,
    "style": constants.BLUR_EFFECT_DARK
};

_VIEW\_CLIP\_SHAPE\_RECTANGLE_: The widget view is rectangle. By default, the value is set.

_VIEW\_CLIP\_SHAPE\_ROUNDED\_RECTANGLE_: The widget view is rectangle with rounded corners.

_VIEW\_CLIP\_SHAPE\_CIRCLE_: The widget view is circular.

**bounds**

A key-value pair represents the bounds of the shape to clip a view. Specify the bounds as an array of integers \[left, top, right, bottom\].

**boundsInPixel**

Defines whether the units of specified bounds should be in pixels or in percentage. The property takes the Boolean value.

_true_: Indicates the specified bounds should be in pixels.

_false_: Indicates the specified bounds should be in percentage.

**radius**

<details close markdown="block"><summary>info Property</summary>

* * *

A custom JSObject with the key value pairs that a developer can use to store the context with the widget. This will help in avoiding the globals to most part of the programming.

### Syntax 

```

info
```

### Type

JSObject

### Read/Write

Yes - (Read and Write)

### Remarks

> **_Note:_** This is a **non-Constructor** property. You cannot set this property through widget constructor. But you can read and write data to it.

Info property can hold any JSObject. After assigning the JSObject to info property, the JSObject should not be modified. For example,

```
var inf = {
    a: 'hello'
};
widget.info = inf; //works
widget.info.a = 'hello world';
/*This will not update the widget info a property to Hello world. 
widget.info.a will have old value as hello*/
```

### Example

```
//Sample code to set info property for a Label widget.

frmLabel.myLabel.info = {
    key: "LABEL"
};

//Reading the info of the Label widget.
voltmx.print("Label widget info:" +frmLabel.myLabel.info);

<details close markdown="block"><summary>left Property</summary>

* * *

This property determines the lower left corner edge of the widget and is measured from the left bounds of the parent container.

The left property determines the position of the left edge of the widget’s bounding box. The value may be set using DP (Device Independent Pixels), Percentage, or Pixels. In freeform layout, the distance is measured from the left edge of the parent container. In flow-vertical layout, the distance is measured from the left edge of the parent container. In flow-horizontal layout, the distance is measured from the right edge of the previous sibling widget in the hierarchy.

### Syntax 

```

left
```

### Type

String

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

If the layoutType is set as voltmx.flex.FLOW\_HORIZONTAL, the left property is measured from right edge of the left sibling widget.

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the left property for widgets by using DP, Percentage and Pixels.
frmHome.widgetID.left = "50dp";

frmHome.widgetID.left = "10%";

frmHome.widgetID.left = "10px";

<details close markdown="block"><summary>maxHeight Property</summary>

* * *

This property specifies the maximum height of the widget and is applicable only when the height property is not specified.

The maxHeight property determines the maximum height of the widget’s bounding box. The value may be set using DP (Device Independent Pixels), Percentage, or Pixels. The maxHeight value overrides the preferred, or “autogrow” height, if the maxHeight is less than the derived content height of the widget.

### Syntax 

```

maxHeight
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the maxHeight property for widgets by using DP, Percentage and Pixels.
frmHome.widgetID.maxHeight = "50dp";

frmHome.widgetID.maxHeight = "10%";

frmHome.widgetID.maxHeight = "10px";

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>maxNumberOfLines Property</summary>

* * *

Defines the maximum number of lines of text allowed in a Label Widget.

### Syntax 

```

maxNumberOfLines
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

If the number of lines of text available in the label are greater than the number of maximum lines defined, the text after the last line displayed is truncated with no ellipses (. . .) by default. You can have the ellipses displayed using the textTruncatePosition property.

If the number of lines of text available in the label are less than the number of maximum lines defined (using the maxNumberOfLines property), the label's height wraps to the number of lines available in the label.

When the property is set to 0 or an invalid value, the maxNumberOfLines property behavior will be unset. That is, Label Widget behaves as if the property is not defined.

Property Behavior in Flex

Suppose a Label Widget is placed in a FlexContainer or a FlexForm. The height of the label is determined either by height constraints (minHeight, height, maxHeight), or by implicit height calculations (centerY, top, and bottom). The height calculated by Label Widget's Flex parameters takes precedence over the maxNumberOfLines property in determining the actual height of the Label Widget.

_Case 1_:

Let the height calculated by Label Widget's Flex parameters permits 10 lines of text to be visible in the label, the maxNumberOfLines property is set to 5, and the actual text can span to 20 lines. This results in display of Label that can fit 10 lines of text, and the text in the label gets truncated at line 5.

_Case 2_:

The height calculated by label's Flex parameters permits five lines of text to fit in the label. The maxNumberOfLines property is set to 10, and the actual text can span to 20 lines. This results in display of Label that can fit five lines of text, and the text truncation is not seen (the truncation occurs at line 10, which is not in visible region).

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the maxNumberOfLines property of a Label widget.   
  
frmLabel.myLabel.maxNumberOfLines = 4;
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>maxWidth Property</summary>

* * *

This property specifies the maximum width of the widget and is applicable only when the width property is not specified.

The Width property determines the maximum width of the widget’s bounding box. The value may be set using DP (Device Independent Pixels), Percentage, or Pixels. The maxWidth value overrides the preferred, or “autogrow” width, if the maxWidth is less than the derived content width of the widget.

### Syntax 

```

maxWidth
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the maxWidth property for widgets by using DP, Percentage and Pixels.
frmHome.widgetID.maxWidth = "50dp";

<details close markdown="block"><summary>pasteboardType Property</summary>

* * *

This property enables an application to share data within the application or with another application using system-wide or application-specific pasteboards. Typically, an object in the application writes data to a pasteboard when the user requests a copy or cut operation on a selection in the user interface. Another object in the same or different application then reads that data from the pasteboard and presents it to the user at a new location; this usually happens when the user requests a paste operation.

### Syntax 

```

pasteboardType
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Yes - (Read and Write)

### Remarks

The different pasteboard types are:

*   constants.PASTE\_BOARD\_TYPE\_DEFAULT: If you select this option, the value selected in the application properties gets applied.
*   constants.PASTE\_BOARD\_TYPE\_SYSTEM\_LEVEL: This is the default selection and if this option is unchanged, the text copied from a Label can be pasted across different applications on the device. Even if you exit the source application, the copied text persists in the memory and can be pasted across applications or within the same application.
*   constants.PASTE\_BOARD\_TYPE\_APP\_LEVEL\_PERSISTENT: If you select this option , the text copied from a Label can be pasted in TextArea or TextBox (with the pasteboard type set as applevel) within the same application. Even if you close the application, the copied text persists in the memory and can be copied to another TextArea whose pasteboard type is applevel, when you restart that application.
*   constants.PASTE\_BOARD\_TYPE\_APP\_LEVEL\_NON\_PERSISTENT: If you select this option, the text copied from a Label can be pasted in TextArea or TextBox within the same application. This text is not retained in the memory when you close the application.

### Example

<details close markdown="block"><summary>right Property</summary>

* * *

This property determines the lower right corner of the widget and is measured from the right bounds of the parent container.

The right property determines the position of the right edge of the widget’s bounding box. The value may be set using DP (Device Independent Pixels), Percentage, or Pixels. In freeform layout, the distance is measured from the left edge of the parent container. In flow-vertical layout, value is ignored. In flow-horizontal layout, the value is ignored.

The right property is used only if the width property is not provided.

### Syntax 

```

right
```

### Type

String

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

If the layoutType is set as voltmx.flex.FLOW\_HORIZONTAL, the right property is measured from left edge of the right sibling widget. The horizontal space between two widgets is measured from right of the left sibling widget and left of the right sibling widget.

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the right property for widgets by using DP, Percentage and Pixels.
frmHome.widgetID.right = "50dp";

frmHome.widgetID.right = "10%";

frmHome.widgetID.right = "10px";
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>shadowColor Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the color for the shadow of the widget.

### Syntax 

```

shadowColor
```

### Type

Color constant or Hexadecimal number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   Colors can be specified using a 6 digit or an 8-digit hex value with alpha position. For example, ffff65 or ffffff00.
*   When the 4-byte color format (RGBA) string is used, an alpha (A) value of 65 specifies that the color is transparent. If the value is 00, the color is opaque. The Alpha value is in percentage and must be given in the hexadecimal value for the color (100% in hexadecimal value is 65).  
    For example, red complete opaque is FF000000. Red complete transparent is FF000065. The values 0x and # are not allowed in the string.
*   A color constant is a String that is defined at the theme level. Ensure that you append the **$** symbol at the beginning of the color constant.
*   This property does not have a default value.
*   This property has more priority than (and overrides) the shadow property of the configured skin. Even if there is no skin configured for the widget, this property updates the skin.

### Example

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have the shadowColor property.

```
Form1.btn1.shadowColor = "ea5075";
```

### Platform Availability

### Syntax 

```

shadowDepth
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The depth of the shadow should be specified in DP (Device Independent Pixels) units. The higher the value of shadowDepth, the appearance of the Label Widget is elevated from the screen and the casted shadow becomes soft.

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the shadowDepth property of a Label widget.

frmLabel.myLabel.shadowDepth = 10;

```

The following table consists of the keys that can be applied to this property. This table also lists whether any change in these keys will be reflected on the canvas.

  
| Property | ### Platform Availability | Description | Reflected on Canvas |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| lineSpacing | Android, iOS, SPA, Desktop Web | A numeric value that controls the space between the lines regardless of the font that is used. This value is set in terms of device-independent pixels (DP). | No |
| letterSpacing | Android, iOS, SPA, Desktop Web | A numeric value that controls the space between the individual letters in the Label widget's text string. This value is set in terms of device-independent pixels (DP). A positive value increases the letter spacing, and a negative value decreases it. | Yes |
| strikeThrough | Android, iOS, SPA, Desktop Web | A Boolean value specifying whether the text is printed with a strikethrough line. The default is false. | Yes |
| strikeThroughStyle | iOS | A constant that controls the style of the strikethrough line. If the strikeThrough property is false, this value is ignored. The strikeThroughStyle property must be passed as an array of arguments. The strikeThroughStyle constants are presented in the table below. | Yes but not for all constants. |
| baseLine | iOS | A floating point value indicating the offset of characters from the baseline. The default value is 0. A positive value raises the characters higher above the baseline and a negative value decreases the spacing. | Yes |
| minLineHeight | iOS | A numeric value that restricts the minimum line height. | No |
| maxLineHeight | iOS | A numeric value that restricts the maximum line height. | No |

In iOS apps, if the strikeThrough property is true, then your app should specify a value for the strikeThroughStyle property from among the following.

  
| Constant | Description | Reflected on Canvas |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TEXTSTYLE\_STRIKETHROUGH\_STYLE\_THICK | Use a thick solid line for the strikethrough. | Yes |
| TEXTSTYLE\_STRIKETHROUGH\_STYLE\_DOUBLE | Use a doubled line for the strikethrough. | Yes |
| TEXTSTYLE\_STRIKETHROUGH\_STYLE\_PATTERN\_DOT | Use a dotted pattern for the strikethrough. | Yes |
| TEXTSTYLE\_STRIKETHROUGH\_STYLE\_PATTERN\_DASH | Use a dashed pattern for the strikethrough. | Yes |
| TEXTSTYLE\_STRIKETHROUGH\_STYLE\_PATTERN\_DASHDOT | Use a combination of dashes and dots for the strikethrough. | Yes |
| TEXTSTYLE\_STRIKETHROUGH\_STYLE\_PATTERN\_DASHDOTDOT | Use a dotted line for the strikethrough. | No |
| TEXTSTYLE\_STRIKETHROUGH\_STYLE\_BY\_WORD | Use strikethrough for the words only and do not strike through the spaces. | No |

> **_Note:_** For all other attributes apart from the ones mentioned above, changes made to the textStyle property will not reflect in the Iris canvas. But the changes will be reflected on the device.

### Example

```
//Writing values to the textStyle property.
form.label.textStyle = {
    "lineSpacing": 10,
    "letterSpacing": 10,
    "strikeThrough": true,

<details close markdown="block"><summary>textTruncatePosition Property</summary>

* * *

Enables the appearance of ellipses at a particular position (start, middle, and end of the line) if the text gets truncated due to the maxNumberOfLines property.

### Syntax 

```

textTruncatePosition
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The property is respected only when the maxNumberOfLines property is defined for a Label Widget.

You can set any one of the following values:

_constants.TEXT\_TRUNCATE\_NONE_: No ellipses appear. This is the default value.

_constants.TEXT\_TRUNCATE\_START_: The ellipses appear at the beginning of the line. Respected only in iOS.

_constants.TEXT\_TRUNCATE\_MIDDLE_: The ellipses appear in the middle of the line. Respected only in iOS.

_constants.TEXT\_TRUNCATE\_END_: The ellipses appear at the end of the line.

### Limitations

*   Android

If you define the property value as either constants.TEXT\_TRUNCATE\_START or constants.TEXT\_TRUNCATE\_MIDDLE, the behavior is the same as constants.TEXT\_TRUNCATE\_END.

When you place a Label Widget in a FlexForm, and apply the textTruncatePosition property, the ellipses appear at the end of last line defined by the maxNumberofLines Property.

For Android, the textTruncatePosition property will not be respected when the [textCopyable](#textCopy) property is set to true because s the Label widget content becomes scrollable to select the full text or a portion of text.

*   iOS

When you place a Label Widget in a FlexForm, and the Label's height is determined by the Label's Flex parameters, the ellipses appear at the end of last appearing line in the Label.

Due to native limitation, when you define both textTruncatePosition and [wrapping](#wrapping) properties to a Label Widget, the property defined last will overwrite the behavior set by another property.

Due to native behavior, when you set the textTruncatePosition property with a valid value (other than the default value), the widget wraps across word boundary ([WIDGET\_TEXT\_WORD\_WRAP](#Word-Wrap)).

*   Windows

If you define the property value as either constants.TEXT\_TRUNCATE\_START or constants.TEXT\_TRUNCATE\_MIDDLE, the behavior is the same as the behavior of constants. TEXT\_TRUNCATE\_END.

When you place a Label Widget in a FlexForm, and the label's height is determined by the label's Flex parameters, the ellipses appear at the end of last visible line in the label.

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the textTruncatePosition property of a Label widget.   
  
frmlabel.myLabel.textTruncatePosition = constants.TEXT_TRUNCATE_END;
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>top Property</summary>

* * *

This property determines the top edge of the widget and measured from the top bounds of the parent container.

The top property determines the position of the top edge of the widget’s bounding box. The value may be set using DP (Device Independent Pixels), Percentage, or Pixels. In freeform layout, the distance is measured from the top edge of the parent container. In flow-vertical layout, the distance is measured from the bottom edge of the previous sibling widget in the hierarchy. In flow-horizontal layout, the distance is measured from the left edge of the parent container.

### Syntax 

```

top
```

### Type

String

### Read/Write

### Remarks

*   For a Segment, the **widgetSwipeMove** Property is configured while setting the data of the Segment.

> **_Note:_** It is not recommended to assign the widgetSwipeMove property on a top Flex container of the segment template widget.

### Limitations

*   When a translation animation is applied to the same widget that has **widgetSwipeMove** already configured, the action which has been performed last takes precedence. For example, if you have set a translation animation on a FlexContainer and then set the _widgetSwipeMove_ property, the actions set in _widgetSwipeMove_ take precedence over the translation animation.
*   The state of the swipe transition of the widget is not retained.
*   In a Segment, the _widgetSwipeMove_ Property must be configured for the rows so that they reset to the previous position.

*   If the widgetSwipeMove property is configured on a top level Flex container of a segment template, the onRowClick event will not be triggered. - Applicable on iOS, Android, and SPA.
*   Android limitation: On Android devices, when the user lifts their finger, the transition occurs immediately.

### Example

Following is a code snippet for a mail app. Here we have used a Segment for listing the mail and the _widgetSwipeMove_ Property has been configured for the _SwipeFlex_ FlexContainer.

```
//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.  
//Here, we have shown how to use the widetSwipeMove property for Button widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the 
widgetSwipeMove property for other applicable widgets.*/  
//### Example of a swipe move configuration.  
var swipeMoveConfig = {
 "translate": true,
 "Xboundaries": ["-60%", "60%"],
 "swipeLeft": [{
  "translateRange": ["-60%", "0%"],
  "callback": null,
  "translatePos": "-60%",
  "translate": true
 }, {
  "translateRange": ["0%", "60%"],
  "callback": null,
  "translatePos": "0%",
  "translate": true
 }],
 "swipeRight": [{
  "translateRange": ["-60%", "0%"],
  "callback": null,
  "translatePos": "0%",
  "translate": true
 }, {
  "translateRange": ["0%", "60%"],
  "callback": this.onCallback1,
  "translatePos": "60%",
  "translate": true
 }]
};  
  
this.view.myButton.widgetSwipeMove=swipeMoveConfig;  

```

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>width Property</summary>

* * *

This property determines the width of the widget and is measured along the x-axis.

The width property determines the width of the widget’s bounding box. The value may be set using DP (Device Independent Pixels), Percentage, or Pixels. For supported widgets, the width may be derived from either the widget or container’s contents by setting the width to “preferred”.

### Syntax 

```

width
```

### Type

Number, String, and Constant

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

Following are the options that can be used as units of width:

*   %: Specifies the values in percentage relative to the parent dimensions.
*   px: Specifies the values in terms of device hardware pixels.
*   dp: Specifies the values in terms of device independent pixels.
*   default: Specifies the default value of the widget.
*   voltmx.flex.USE\_PREFERED\_SIZE: When this option is specified, the layout uses preferred width of the widget as width and preferred size of the widget is determined by the widget and may varies between platforms.

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the width property for widgets by using DP, Percentage and Pixels.
frmHome.widgetID.width = "50dp";

frmHome.widgetID.width = "10%";

frmHome.widgetID.width = "10px";
```

### Platform Availability

<details close markdown="block"><summary>wrapping Property</summary>

* * *

When the content of the label reaches the boundaries, it starts wrapping.

### Syntax 

```

wrapping
```

### Type

String

### Read/Write

No

### Remarks

The default value for this property is WIDGET\_TEXT\_WORD\_WRAP.

While wrapping, two strategies can be applied:

*   Word Wrapping: Wrap or clip the string only at word boundaries.
*   Character Wrapping: Wrap or clip the string at the closest character boundary.

The available options are:

*   WIDGET\_TEXT\_WORD\_WRAP: Specifies if the complete word must be moved to the next line when you reach the right margin. This is the default wrapping property.
*   WIDGET\_TEXT\_CHAR\_WRAP: Specifies if the characters in a word must be moved to the next line when you reach the right margin.

The following image illustrates the character wrapping property:

### Example

```
 //Sample code to set the wrapping property of a Label widget.  
  
frmLabel.myLabel.wrapping=constants.WIDGET_TEXT_WORD_WRAP;
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>zIndex Property</summary>

* * *

This property specifies the stack order of a widget. A widget with a higher zIndex is always in front of a widget with a lower zIndex.

The zIndex property is used to set the stack, or layer order of a widget. Widgets with higher values will appear “over”, or “on top of” widgets with lower values. Widgets layered over other widgets will override any interaction events tied to widgets beneath. Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets in the VoltMX Iris hierarchy, inside of a flexContainer or form. The zIndex property accepts only positive values.

### Syntax 

```

zIndex
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The default value for this property is 1.

> **_Note:_** Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets inside the FlexContainer. If zIndex is same for group of overlapping widgets then widget order decides the order of overlapping. The last added widget is displayed on top.

From VoltMX Iris V9 SP2 FP7, developers can configure the Z Index value for a Responsive Web app as **Auto** or **Custom**. When the selected Z Index value is **Auto**, the default Z Index value of 1 is applied. When the selected Z Index value is **Custom**, developers can specify a desired numeric value.

Prior to the V9 SP2 FP7 release, the default value for the Z Index was **1**. When developers imported any third-party libraries with the Z index set as **Auto**, content overflow was disabled as the value of Auto is less than 1.

> **_Note:_** The Z Index value Auto is supported only when the Enable JS Library mode is configured as unchecked.

For existing components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Custom** with **1** as the value.

For new components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Auto** or **1** based on the project level settings.

> **_Note:_** If ModalContainer property is set to true in any of the FlexContainer widget, the Z Index value of that container and all of its parent containers should be set to **Custom**.

**voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO** : Constant to configure the Z Index value as **auto** programmatically.

```
//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto  
 var flx = new voltmx.ui.FlexContainer({ 
  "id": "flx"
  "zIndex": voltmx.flex.ZINDEX_AUTO
});

```
```
//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto
flx.zIndex = voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO;

```

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the zIndex property for widgets.  
frmHome.widgetID.zIndex = 300;
```
