======================

The properties for the Segment widget are:

* * *


<details close markdown="block"><summary>accessibilityConfig Property</summary>

* * *

Enables you to control accessibility behavior and alternative text for the widget.

For more information on using accessibility features in your app, see the [Accessibility](../../../Iris/app_design_dev/Content/Accessibility_Overview.md) appendix in the VoltMX IrisUser Guide.

### Syntax

```

accessibilityConfig
```

### Type

Object

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   The accessibilityConfig property is enabled for all the widgets which are supported under the Flex Layout.

> **_Note:_** From VoltMX Iris V9 SP2 GA version, you can provide i18n keys as values to all the attributes used inside the `accessibilityConfig` property. Values provided in the i18n keys take precedence over values provided in `a11yLabel`, `a11yValue`, and `a11yHint` fields.

The accessibilityConfig property is a JavaScript object which can contain the following key-value pairs.

  
| Key | Type | Description | ARIA Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a11yIndex | Integer with no floating or decimal number. | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the order in which the widgets are focused on a screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-index`, `index`, or `taborder` properties. |
| a11yLabel | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies alternate text to identify the widget. Generally the label should be the text that is displayed on the screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-labelledby` property of ARIA in HTML. > **_Note:_** For the Image widget, this parameter maps to the **alt** attribute of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yValue | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | This parameter is similar to the a11yLabel parameter. If the a11yValue is defined, the value of a11yValue is appended to the value of a11yLabel. These values are separated by a space. |
| a11yHint | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-describedby` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yHidden | Boolean | This is an optional parameter. Specifies if the widget should be ignored by assistive technology. The default option is set to _false_. This option is supported on iOS 5.0 and above, Android 4.1 and above, and SPA | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-hidden` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yARIA | Object | This is an optional parameter. For each widget, the key and value provided in this object are added as the attribute and value of the HTML tags respectively. Any values provided for attributes such as `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` using this attribute, takes precedence over values given in `a11yLabel` and `a11yHint` fields. When a widget is provided with the following key value pair or attribute using the a11yARIA object, the tabIndex of the widget is automatically appended as zero.`{"role": "main"}``aria-label` | This parameter is only available on the Desktop Web platform. |

Android limitations

*   If the results of the concatenation of a11y fields result in an empty string, then `accessibilityConfig` is ignored and the text that is on widget is read out.
*   The soft keypad does not gain accessibility focus during the right/left swipe gesture when the keypad appears.

SPA/Desktop Web limitations

*   When `accessibilityConfig` property is configured for any widget, the `tabIndex` attribute is added automatically to the `accessibilityConfig` property.
*   The behavior of accessibility depends on the Web browser, Web browser version, Voice Over Assistant, and Voice Over Assistant version.
*   Currently SPA/Desktop web applications support only a few ARIA tags. To achieve more accessibility features, use the attribute a11yARIA. The corresponding tags will be added to the DOM as per these configurations.

### Example 1

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have an accessibilityConfig property.

```
//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the accessibilityConfig Property for button widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the accessibilityConfig property for other applicable widgets.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "Label",
    "a11yValue": "Value",
    "a11yHint": "Hint"    
};
```

### Example 2

This example uses the button widget to implement internationalization in `accessibilityConfig` property, but the principle remains the same for all widgets.

```
/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Native platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString("key1")     
};  
/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Desktop Web platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString(\"key3\")"
};
```

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>alternateRowSkin Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the skin that is applied to every alternate _even numbered_ row in the segment.

### Syntax

```

alternateRowSkin
```

### Type

String

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

For example, if you have 5 segments, the alternate row skin is applied to segments 2 and 4.

If you delete any even segment using the method [removeAt](Segment_Methods.md#removeAt), the odd indexes will reset and become even. The Alternate skin is applied to these new even indexes.  
For example, if you have 5 segments and you delete segment 2, the odd indexes reset and segment 3 becomes segment 2 and the alternate skin is applied to it.

### Example

```
//Sample code to define the alternateRowSkin property for Segment.
frmSegment.mySegment.alternateRowSkin="alternateSkin";
```

### Platform Availability

*   Available in the IDE
*   Available on all platforms

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>anchorPoint Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the anchor point of the widget bounds rectangle using the widget's coordinate space.

### Syntax

```

anchorPoint
```

### Type

JSObject

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The value for this property is a JavaScript dictionary object with the keys "x" and "y". The values for the "x" and "y" keys are floating-point numbers ranging from 0 to 1. All geometric manipulations to the widget occur about the specified point. For example, applying a rotation transform to a widget with the default anchor point causes the widget to rotate around its center.

The default value for this property is center ( {"x":0.5, "y":0.5} ), that represents the center of the widgets bounds rectangle. The behavior is undefined if the values are outside the range zero (0) to one (1).

### Example

```
Form1.widget1.anchorPoint = {
    "x": 0.5,
    "y": 0.5
};
```

### Platform Availability

*   iOS, Android, Windows, and SPA

<details close markdown="block"><summary>animateFocusChanges Property</summary>

* * *

This property is used to bring the row specified in the selectedRowIndex property to the visible region.

### Syntax

```

animateFocusChanges
```

### Type

Boolean

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   If you set the animateFocusChanges property as true, the row specified in the [selectedRowIndex](#selected) property moves to the viewable area on the screen with animation. This property is supported for all the values of the property [viewtype](#viewType).
*   If you set the animateFocusChanges property as false, the selected row moves to the viewable area without animation.

### Example

```
frmHome.seg.animateFocusChanges = true;
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>autogrowMode Property (Deprecated)</summary>

* * *

The autogrowMode property is deprecated in 6.0.3 release. The autogrowMode property is used to set the height of a widget dynamically based on the derived height of the widget’s content, or from the child widget’s contents. The options are:

*   voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_NONE (value is 0)
*   voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT (value is 1)

### Syntax

```

autogrowMode
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read only

### Remarks

> **_Note:_** If you want to configure this property in VoltMX Iris, configure the height property of FlexContainer as preferred, then VoltMX Iris generates the autogrowMode property as voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT.

The default value for this property is voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_NONE.

> **_Note:_** If one or all the child widgets height or other properties such as centerY, top, bottom, minHeight or maxHeight are used in determining the height given in percentage (%), then the autogrowMode property will not work for the FlexContainer and its height fallback to default configuration value.

Rules and priorities of autogrowMode property

*   The autogrowMode property is ignored if the height of the widget is computable either through explicit value or implicit calculation.
    
*   If the autogrowMode property is configured as voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT, then preferredSize (based on content or child widgets ) is computed, and min/max constraints are applied.
*   If the autogrowMode property is configured as voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_NONE, the default value is applied with min/max constraints.
*   The height of a FlexContainer widget will not grow dynamically if the height of any widget changes because of the change in widget's skin state (such as from normal to focus).
*   If a widgets top value is given in negative values, then the widget is clipped in case of Free Form and overlapped on the previous widget in case of Flow Vertical.
*   The autogrowMode property is not supported for a FlexContainer widget that is placed inside an HBox or a VBox.
*   For example, a FlexContainer (flexA) has a FlexContainer (flexB), which is not set to grow dynamically, whose clipBounds is set to false. The children of flexB that are out of the bounds of flexB do not have any effect on the height of flexA. Only the heights of direct children of flexA will decide the height of flexA.
*   In templates, FlexContainer will grow only in SegmentedUI Table View only. In all other views, autogrowMode property is not supported.
*   The autogrowMode property for a FlexContainer is not supported in the Tab Widget.
*   In the Windows 10 platform, the autogrowMode property of a SegmentedUI is not supported inside a FlexContainer.
*   In the Android platform, the autogrowMode property of a SegmentedUI with a large number of rows leads to performance and memory issues.
*   When animating the height property of the child widget of a FlexContainer in iOS, Windows, and SPA platforms, after the animation is complete, then parent containers height increases based on the value provided in 100th step when fillMode is configured as voltmx.anim.FILL\_MODE\_FORWARDS.
*   When animating the height property of the child widget of a FlexContainer in the Android platform, the parent container's height grows along with the child widget's height.

When to Use

*    If the height of the FlexContainer is dependent on the heights of the child widgets that are added.
*   If you are using the FlexContainer in a SegmentedUI template, where each row of the SegmentedUI row height is dependent on the child widgets content. Configure the height property of the FlexContainer as preferred, then VoltMX Iris generates the autogrowMode property as voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT.

### Example

Setting the autogrowMode property on an existing widget

```

//widget will use the set height flex property to derive height
frmHome.autogrow1.autogrowMode=voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW_NONE;

//widget will use the widget contents or child widget contents to derive height
frmHome.autogrow1.autogrowMode=voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW_HEIGHT;
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>contentInsetAdjustmentType Property</summary>

* * *

On scroll view, the contentInsetAdjustmentBehaviour property automatically adds the required SegmentedUI insets to the scroll view. This automatic addition of insets occurs when the content in the scroll view is not in the safe area and if the value is set to constants.CONTENTINSET\_ADJUSTMENT\_AUTOMATIC.

As specified later, this property plays an important role in various iPhone X layout scenarios.

### Syntax

```

contentInsetAdjustmentType
```

### Type

Constant (Number)

### Read/Write

Read + Write

Constants exposed to JsWorld

*   constants. CONTENTINSET\_ADJUSTMENT\_AUTOMATIC: Automatically adjusts the SegmentedUI insets.
    
*   constants.CONTENTINSET\_ADJUSTMENT\_SCROLLABLEAXES: Adjusts the SegmentedUI insets in only scrollable directions.
    
*   constants.CONTENTINSET\_ADJUSTMENT\_NEVER: Does not adjust the SegmentedUI insets.
    
*   constants.CONTENTINSET\_ADJUSTMENT\_ALWAYS: Always includes the SegmentedUI insets in content adjustment.
    

Default Value

*   constants. CONTENTINSET\_ADJUSTMENT\_NEVER
    

iPhone X Layout Scenario

If you want to position the Segment in the lower unsafe area of iPhone X, you must enable the extendBottom property for the form. In that scenario, if you want to view the entire Segment as a whole after scrolling, you must set the contentInsetAdjustmentType property to constants.CONTENTINSET\_ADJUSTMENT\_AUTOMATIC.

In all other cases, you must set the contentInsetAdjustmentType property to its default value of constants.CONTENTINSET\_ADJUSTMENT\_NEVER.

When the extendBottom property for the form is set to true, the relevant states of the iPhone X layout are as follows:

**State 1**: Before scrolling

![](Resources/Images/iPhone_X_Layout_State_1.png)

State 2: After scrolling; with contentInsetAdjustmentType = constants.CONTENTINSET\_ADJUSTMENT\_NEVER

![](Resources/Images/iphone_X_Layout_State_2.png)

**State 3**: After scrolling; with contentInsetAdjustmentType = constants.CONTENTINSET\_ADJUSTMENT\_AUTOMATIC

<details close markdown="block"><summary>contentOffsetMeasured Property</summary>

* * *

This property returns the current coordinates of the top left corner of the scrollable region in the segment.

### Syntax

```

contentOffsetMeasured
```

### Type

JavaScript Object

### Read/Write

Read only

### Remarks

Returns the following key:value pairs:

{x:valueInDP, y:valueInDP}

The values are numbers that represent device pixels (DP).

Limitation

If the Image widget has preferred height and if the image source is from the network, i.e., **src**, the contentOffsetMeadured property does not turn on.

The segment widget reuses row-templates. Rows which move out of the screen stop downloading the image and that affects the height calculation of the row height.

### Example

```

var offset = frmHome.seg.contentOffsetMeasured;
voltmx.print (“contentOffsetMeasured:” + frmHome.seg.contentOffsetMeasured);
```

    You will find that the details of the hover skin is not enabled here.
4.  Check the **Enable** option to add a hover skin to your widget.  
    The details and configurations of the hover skin is enabled.
5.  Under the **General** section, for the Platform option, click the ellipsis icon.  
    The **Fork Skin** window appears.
6.  In the **Fork Skin** window, for **Desktop**, check under **HTML5 SPA**.
7.  Click **Ok**. You have successfully forked your hover skin for Desktop Web application.  
    You can see that the **Cursor Type** property has been added under the **General** section.
8.  Select a value from the drop-down list to set the **Cursor Type** for the widget.

### Example

*   Format1: Set the data without any sections.
*   Format 2: Set the data with sections where section header is a name.
*   Format 3: Set the data with sections where header is driven by template.

The below table explains the type and description of template key:

<table style="width: 100%;mc-table-style: url('Resources/Stylesheets/Basic.css');border-top-left-radius: 0px;border-top-right-radius: 0px;border-bottom-right-radius: 0px;border-bottom-left-radius: 0px;border-left-style: solid;border-left-width: 2px;border-left-color: #000000;border-right-style: solid;border-right-width: 2px;border-right-color: #000000;border-top-style: solid;border-top-width: 2px;border-top-color: #000000;border-bottom-style: solid;border-bottom-width: 2px;border-bottom-color: #000000;margin-left: 0;margin-right: auto;" class="TableStyle-Basic" cellspacing="0"><colgroup><col style="width: 121px;" class="TableStyle-Basic-Column-Column1"> <col style="width: 124px;" class="TableStyle-Basic-Column-Column1"> <col class="TableStyle-Basic-Column-Column1"> <col style="width: 331px;" class="TableStyle-Basic-Column-Column1"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1"><td style="font-weight: bold;color: #ffffff;background-color: #005386;text-align: center;" class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Key</td><td style="font-weight: bold;color: #ffffff;background-color: #005386;text-align: center;" class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Key</td><td style="font-weight: bold;color: #ffffff;background-color: #005386;text-align: center;" class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Type</td><td style="font-weight: bold;color: #ffffff;background-color: #005386;text-align: center;" class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyD-Column1-Body1">Comments</td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-Basic-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyB-Column1-Body1">template</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyB-Column1-Body1">Not Applicable</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyB-Column1-Body1">JavaScript: Object</td><td class="TableStyle-Basic-BodyA-Column1-Body1">Indicates the template to be used for the specific row</td></tr></tbody></table>

### Example

```
//Sample code to define data property for a Segment widget.
frmSegment.mySegment.data = [{
 "dataId1": "data1",
 "dataId2": "data2",
 "dataId3": "data3",
 "accessibilityConfig": "acObject"
}, {
 "dataId1": "datax",
 "dataId2": "datay",
 "dataId3": "dataz",
 "template": "box1",
 "accessibilityConfig": "acObject"
}];
```

### Example of Format 1

```
[{
    "dataId1": "foo",
    "dataId2": "foo",
    "dataId3": "foo",
    "accessibilityConfig": "acObject"
}, {
    "dataId1": "bar",
    "dataId2": "bar",
    "dataId3": "bar",
    "template": "boxRef2",
    "accessibilityConfig": "acObject"
}, {
    "dataId1": "bar",
    "dataId2": "bar",
    "dataId3": {
        "isVisible" :true,
      "skin" : "nskin",
      "focusSkin": "fskin",
      "text" : "Foo"
    },
    "accessibilityConfig": "acObject"
}]
```

In the above example, **template** is the standard key which can be optionally to override the common rowTemplate provided with a specific template for the row. For template always the value has to be valid box reference, if not it falls back to the common rowTemplate. **mentainfo** is another standard key which can be used to specify meta information about the row. iOS specific standard parameters that **metainfo** can support are _clickable, skin and editmode_.

In the above examples, the values of dataId1, dataId2 are shown as string, but dataId3 is key value pair. The key value pair format allows you to set the properties specific to the widget. In the above example, you are setting the _isVisible_ property to true and **text** property to "Foo", **skin** property with ID nskin and **focusSkin** to a skin with ID fskin. If a string is provided, typically is mapped to the **text** property for button and labels and the _src_ property for the image.

### Example of Format 2

```
/*set the data with sections where section header is a name. 
This example has two sections and each section with two rows.*/
[
    ["section1", [{
        "dataId1": "foo",
        "dataId2": "foo",
        "dataId3": "foo",
        "accessibilityConfig": "acObject"
    }, {
        "dataId1": "bar",
        "dataId2": "bar",
        "dataId3": "bar",
        "accessibilityConfig": "acObject"
    }], "acObject"],
    ["section2", [{
        "dataId1": "foo",
        "dataId2": "foo",
        "dataId3": "foo",
        "accessibilityConfig": "acObject"
    }, {
        "dataId1": "bar",
        "dataId2": "bar",
        "dataId3": "bar",
        "accessibilityConfig": "acObject"
    }], "acObject"]

Use Components without Contract in Segment Templates

You can use components without contract inside Segment templates. You can map the child widgets of the component to a key in the [widgetDataMap](#widgetDa) property by using the dot operator.

The **data** property is then used to set the values that are to be displayed in the child widgets of the component. You can assign this set of values directly to the key or to the properties of the child widgets.

> **_Note:_** Segment Templates do not provide support for component with contract.

In the following example, after the mapping is done, the **data** property assigns value to the _Comp1lbl1_ and _Comp1Img1_ keys. This value is then assigned to the child widgets- _lbl1_ and _img1_ of the _segComp1_component.

```
/*In this example, segComp1 is the component with lbl1 and img1 as child widgets. Comp1lbl1, and Comp1Img1 are the keys.*/  
mySegment.widgetDataMap = {
 " template1": " template1",
 "segComp1.lbl1": "Comp1lbl1",
 "segComp1.img1": "Comp1Img1"
};
//There are two methods to assign data to the widgets inside the component.  
//Method One- assign directly by using the key  
mySegment.data = [{
  "comp1lbl1": "Row One",
  "comp1img1": "icon1.png"
 },
 {
  "comp1lbl1": "Row Two",
  "comp1img1": "icon2.png"
 }
];
//Method Two- assign to the properties of the child widgets
mySegment.data = [{
  "comp1lbl1": {
   "text": "Row One",
   "skin": "lblskn1"
  },
  "comp1img1": {
   "src": "icon1.png",
   "left": "100dp"
  }
 },
 {
  "comp1lbl1": {
   "text": "Row Two",
   "skin": "lblskn1"
  },
  "comp1img1": {
   "src": "icon2.png",
   "left": "10dp"
  }
 }
];  

```

> **_Note:_** When components are rendered inside a Segment template, the events and gestures assigned to the child widgets of the components are retained.

### Remarks

This is optional parameter and if not provided the default template provided by each platform will be used. It can also be provided at each section level when setting the data. Please refer [data](#data) property for examples.

When a Section Header is provided along with the rows/items, the Section Header is "clamped" to the top of the scrollable area (on the Form) as one scrolls through a long list of items (for example, if you have a long list of contacts that all begin with the letter "A", the "A" header will be fixed at the top until you scroll down past the last "A" item). This behavior can be clearly seen iPhone's Contacts application.  
  
This behavior of Section Headers is available on iOS and Android platform and is enabled when the [screenLevelWidget](#screenLe) has been set to true.

### Syntax

```

selectedRowIndex
```

### Type

Array

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The index is with respect to the order in which data is set with [data](#data) property.

Programmatically setting the selectedRow Index will not make any visible differences in the row, however it will bring the row at the index into the view able area on the screen.

Setting this value before the parent form is shown may result in the value not being changed. To avoid this you can set this value in the onDidFinishDataLoading callback for the SegmentUI widget.

Setting this value it to _null/nil_ clears the selection state and also sets the [selectedRowIndices](#selected2) to _null_ in cases where segui selection behavior is SEGUI\_SINGLE\_SELECT or SEGUI\_DEFAULT\_BEHAVIOR or SEGUI\_MULTI\_SELECT\_BEHAVIOR.

The selectedRowIndex is not updated when clicked on any child widget of a Row. For example, a Button or an HBox.

selectedRowIndex Array format:

```
[sectionIndex1, [rowIndex1],  
  
For example,  
[1,3] indicates 4th row in 2nd section.  
[1,4] indicates 5th row in 2nd section.
```

selectedRowIndex is not updated when a row is swiped in PAGE\_VIEW or COVERFLOW\_VIEW. It is updated only when clicked on a row.

If data contains the sections then the _selectedIndex_ indicates the selected row index within the section.

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the selectedRowIndex property for a Segment as four.
frmSegment.mySegment.selectedRowIndex= 4;  
  
//Reading the selectedRowIndex of the Segment widget.
voltmx.print("SegmentedUI selectedRowIndex ::" + frmSegment.mySegment.selectedRowIndex);

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

Setting this value before the parent form is shown may result in the value not being changed. To avoid this you can set this value in the onDidFinishDataLoading callback for the SegmentUI widget.

In case of MULTI\_SELECT there can be more than one selected index and the array represents the same.

In case of SINGLE\_SELECT and DEFAULT\_BEHAVIOR the array contains only one element indicating the [selectedIndex](#selected).

Setting it to _null/nil_ clears the selection state and also sets the selectedIndices to _null/nil_.

The selectedRowIndices is not updated when clicked on any child widget of a Row. For example, a Button or an HBox.

When this property is read from the SegmentedUI the list structure depends on the usage of sections.

selectedRowIndices Array format:

```
[  
 [sectionIndex1, [rowIndex1, rowIndex2, ...],  
 [sectionIndex3, [rowIndex4, rowIndex5, ...],  
 .....  
]  

```

For example:

*   \[ **\[0, \[2\] \]** \] indicates 3rd row is selected in the first selection.
*   \[ **\[0, \[1, 4\] \]** \] indicates 2nd and 5th rows are selected in the first section.  
    
*   \[ **\[0, \[0, 3\] \]**, **\[2, \[1, 3, 4\] \]** \] indicates the 1st, 4th rows, of 1st section and also 2nd , 4th and 5th rows in 3rd section.  
    

> **_Note:_** selectedRowIndices is not updated when a row is swiped in PAGE\_VIEW or COVERFLOW\_VIEW. It is updated only when clicked on a row.

Behavior when data is modified in the segment

> *   If you set new data in the segment using the _[setData](Segment_Methods.md#setData)_ method, the earlier selected indices are cleared.
> *   If you add additional data to the segment using the _[addAll](Segment_Methods.md#addAll)_ method, the earlier selected indices are retained.

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the selectedRowIndices property for a Segment as [4,5].
frmSegment.mySegment.selectedRowIndices= [4, 5];  
  
//Reading the selectedRowIndices of the Segment widget.

This property is set to the identify transform by default. Any transformations applied to the widget occur relative to the widget's anchor point. The transformation contained in this property must be created using the [voltmx.ui.makeAffineTransform](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/voltmx.ui_functions.md#makeAffi) function.

### Example

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have a transform property.

```
//Animation sample
var newTransform = voltmx.ui.makeAffineTransform();
newTransform.translate3D(223, 12, 56);

//translates by 223 xAxis,12 in yAxis,56 in zAxis
widget.transform = newTransform;
```

### Remarks

When the viewType is set as SEGUI\_VIEW\_TYPE\_COVERFLOW, then you can set the viewConfig Property through canvas for Android.

You can set the following properties for Android:

> *   **projectionAngle** \[Number\]: Specifies the angle in degrees between a row except at center and z-axis. When the projection angle is 0, all rows are aligned along z-axis one after the other. When previewed, only one rows appears at the center. When the projection angle is 90, all rows are aligned along x-axis side by side. If the value entered is negative, then the resultant angle is 90 + entered value. For example, if the projection angle is -30 then resultant projection angle, is 90 - 30 = 60 degrees. Projection angle accepts a range between -90 and +90 only.  
>     
> *   **rowItemRotationAngle**\[Number\]: Specifies the angle in degrees of rotation of each row along its own y-axis. The parameter accepts a range between 0 and 360.  
>     
> *   **spaceBetweenRowItems** \[Number\]: Specifies the space between each row. The parameter accepts the value in pixels.  
>     
> *   **rowItemWidth**\[Number\]: Specifies the width in percentage relative to its parent width. The parameter accepts a range between 1 and 100.  
>     
> *   **isCircular**\[Boolean\]: When set to true, isCircular parameter specifies the widget to scroll endlessly (repeating the first row after you reach the last row). When set to false, the widget stops scrolling after you reach the last row.

For iOS, isCircular is the only parameter that is applicable.

*   **isCircular**\[Boolean\]: When set to true, isCircular parameter specifies the widget to scroll endlessly (repeating the first row after you reach the last row). When set to false, the widget stops scrolling after you reach the last row.  
      
    isCircular property needs to be given in the following ways in iOS:

*   SEGUI\_VIEW\_TYPE\_COVERFLOW  
    viewConfig:{coverflowConfig:{isCircular:true}}
*   SEGUI\_VIEW\_TYPE\_CYLINDER  
    viewConfig:{cylinderConfig:{isCircular:true}}
*   SEGUI\_VIEW\_TYPE\_INVERTED\_CYLINDER  
    viewConfig:{invertedCylinderConfig:{isCircular:true}}
*   SEGUI\_VIEW\_TYPE\_INVERTED\_ROTARY  
    viewConfig:{invertedRotatoryConfig:{isCircular:true}}
*   SEGUI\_VIEW\_TYPE\_LINEAR  
    viewConfig:{linearConfig:{isCircular:true}}
*   SEGUI\_VIEW\_TYPE\_ROTARY  
    viewConfig:{rotatoryConfig:{isCircular:true}}
*   SEGUI\_VIEW\_TYPE\_STACK  
    viewConfig:{stackConfig:{isCircular:true}}

When the viewType is set as SEGUI\_VIEW\_TYPE\_TABLEVIEW(in iOS), viewConfig will have the following keys:

*   **tableViewConfig**\[JSObject\]: This is a string key whose value is a map which accepts the configurations for customizing the index bar of the table view. Following are the keys and their respective values:
*   **indexColor** \[String\]: Specifies the color of the index in hex format as a string. This option is available from iOS 6 and above.
*   **indexBackgroundColor** \[String\]: Specifies the background color of the index in hex format as a string. This option is available from iOS 7 and above.
*   **indexTrackingBackgroundColor** \[String\]: Specifies the tracking background color of the index in hex format as a string. This option is available from iOS 6 and above.

All the above keys are optional.

### Remarks

It is developer responsibility to ensure that widgetDataMap to accommodate all the widget ids required including the widgets referred in dynamic templates.

```
{  
 widgetID1: "dataId1",  
 widgetId2: "dataId2",  
 widgetId3: "dtaId3",  
 widgetId4: "secDataId1"  
 widgetId5: "secDataId2"  
}  

```

> **_Note:_** Only after you specify the mapping information, you can use the [Methods](Segment_Methods.md#segmentedui-methods) applicable for a segment.

### Example

```
/*Sample code to set the properties for a Segment with widgetDataMap:
{widgetId1:"dataid1", widgetId2:"dataId2", widgetId3:"dataId3",
 widgetId4:"secDataId1", widgetId5:"secDataId2" }. */
frmSegment.mySegment.widgetDataMap= {
        widgetId1: "dataid1",
        widgetId2: "dataId2",
        widgetId3: "dataId3",
        widgetId4: "secDataId1",
        widgetId5: "secDataId2"
    };  

```

Use Components without Contract in Segment Templates

You can use components without contract inside Segment templates. You can map the child widgets of the component to a key in the **widgetDataMap** property by using the dot operator.

The **[data](#data)** property is then used to set the values that are to be displayed in the child widgets of the component. You can assign this set of values directly to the key or to the properties of the child widgets.

> **_Note:_** Segment Templates do not provide support for component with contract.

In the following example, after the mapping is done, the **[data](#data)** property assigns value to the _Comp1lbl1_ and _Comp1Img1_ keys. This value is then assigned to the child widgets- _lbl1_ and _img1_ of the _segComp1_ component.

```
  
/*In this example, segComp1 is the component with lbl1 and img1 as child widgets. Comp1lbl1 and Comp1Img1 are the keys.*/  
mySegment.widgetDataMap = {
 " template1": " template1",
 "segComp1.lbl1": "Comp1lbl1",
 "segComp1.img1": "Comp1Img1"
};
//There are two methods to assign data to the widgets inside the component.  
//Method One- assign directly by using the key  
mySegment.data = [{
  "comp1lbl1": "Row One",
  "comp1img1": "icon1.png"
 },
 {
  "comp1lbl1": "Row Two",
  "comp1img1": "icon2.png"
 }
];
//Method Two- assign to the properties of the child widgets
mySegment.data = [{
  "comp1lbl1": {
   "text": "Row One",
   "skin": "lblskn1"
  },
  "comp1img1": {
   "src": "icon1.png",
   "left": "100dp"
  }
 },
 {
  "comp1lbl1": {
   "text": "Row Two",
   "skin": "lblskn1"
  },
  "comp1img1": {
   "src": "icon2.png",
   "left": "10dp"
  }
 }
];
```

> **_Note:_** When components are rendered inside a Segment template, the events and gestures assigned to the child widgets of the components are retained.

### Remarks

*   For a Segment, the **widgetSwipeMove** Property is configured while setting the data of the Segment.

> **_Note:_** It is not recommended to assign the widgetSwipeMove property on a top Flex container of the segment template widget.

Limitations

*   When a translation animation is applied to the same widget that has **widgetSwipeMove** already configured, the action which has been performed last takes precedence. For example, if you have set a translation animation on a FlexContainer and then set the _widgetSwipeMove_ property, the actions set in _widgetSwipeMove_ take precedence over the translation animation.
*   The state of the swipe transition of the widget is not retained.
*   In a Segment, the _widgetSwipeMove_ Property must be configured for the rows so that they reset to the previous position.

*   If the widgetSwipeMove property is configured on a top level Flex container of a segment template, the onRowClick event will not be triggered. - Applicable on iOS, Android, and SPA.
*   Android limitation: On Android devices, when the user lifts their finger, the transition occurs immediately.

### Example

Following is a code snippet for a mail app. Here we have used a Segment for listing the mail and the _widgetSwipeMove_ Property has been configured for the _SwipeFlex_ FlexContainer.

```
//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.  
//Here, we have shown how to use the widetSwipeMove property for Button widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the

<details close markdown="block"><summary>width Property</summary>

* * *

This property determines the width of the widget and is measured along the x-axis.

The width property determines the width of the widget’s bounding box. The value may be set using DP (Device Independent Pixels), Percentage, or Pixels. For supported widgets, the width may be derived from either the widget or container’s contents by setting the width to “preferred”.

### Syntax

```

width
```

### Type

Number, String, and Constant

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

Following are the options that can be used as units of width:

*   %: Specifies the values in percentage relative to the parent dimensions.
*   px: Specifies the values in terms of device hardware pixels.
*   dp: Specifies the values in terms of device independent pixels.
*   default: Specifies the default value of the widget.
*   voltmx.flex.USE\_PREFERED\_SIZE: When this option is specified, the layout uses preferred width of the widget as width and preferred size of the widget is determined by the widget and may varies between platforms.

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the width property for widgets by using DP, Percentage and Pixels.
frmHome.widgetID.width = "50dp";

frmHome.widgetID.width = "10%";

frmHome.widgetID.width = "10px";

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>zIndex Property</summary>

* * *

This property specifies the stack order of a widget. A widget with a higher zIndex is always in front of a widget with a lower zIndex.

The zIndex property is used to set the stack, or layer order of a widget. Widgets with higher values will appear “over”, or “on top of” widgets with lower values. Widgets layered over other widgets will override any interaction events tied to widgets beneath. Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets in the VoltMX Iris hierarchy, inside of a flexContainer or form. The zIndex property accepts only positive values.

### Syntax

```

zIndex
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The default value for this property is 1.

> **_Note:_** Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets inside the FlexContainer. If zIndex is same for group of overlapping widgets then widget order decides the order of overlapping. The last added widget is displayed on top.

From VoltMX Iris V9 SP2 FP7, developers can configure the Z Index value for a Responsive Web app as **Auto** or **Custom**. When the selected Z Index value is **Auto**, the default Z Index value of 1 is applied. When the selected Z Index value is **Custom**, developers can specify a desired numeric value.

Prior to the V9 SP2 FP7 release, the default value for the Z Index was **1**. When developers imported any third-party libraries with the Z index set as **Auto**, content overflow was disabled as the value of Auto is less than 1.

> **_Note:_** The Z Index value Auto is supported only when the Enable JS Library mode is configured as unchecked.

For existing components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Custom** with **1** as the value.

For new components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Auto** or **1** based on the project level settings.

> **_Note:_** If ModalContainer property is set to true in any of the FlexContainer widget, the Z Index value of that container and all of its parent containers should be set to **Custom**.

**voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO** : Constant to configure the Z Index value as **auto** programmatically.

```
//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto  
 var flx = new voltmx.ui.FlexContainer({ 
  "id": "flx"
  "zIndex": voltmx.flex.ZINDEX_AUTO
});

```
