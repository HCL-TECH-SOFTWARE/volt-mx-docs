======================

This section provides the methods associated with the CollectionView widget. You can use these methods across all platforms.

> **_Note:_** The methods described in this section can be used only after you specify the mapping information between the widget IDs and the keys in the data using the [widgetDataMap](CollectionView_Properties.md#widgetDa) property.

Additionally, you can also specify _Meta Info_ for items as explained in [data](CollectionView_Properties.md#data) property.

* * *


<details close markdown="block"><summary>addAll Method</summary>

* * *

This method allows you to add new items to the collection.

### Syntax
```

addAll(data)
```

### Parameters

data

Specifies an array that represents data as key value pairs. The format of the array is explained in [data](CollectionView_Properties.md#data) property of the collection.

### Remarks

The new data is appended to the existing data. If the collection has no data, the new data is placed in the collection.

Using this method, you cannot add the items to the existing sections.

### Example

```

//Sample code to invoke addAll method by using a CollectionView widget.  
frmCollection.myCollection.addAll([{
    dataId1: "data1",
    dataId2: "data2",
    dataId3: "data3"
}, {
    dataId1: "datax",
    dataId2: "datay",
    dataId3: "dataz",
    template: box1
}]);  

```

### Platform Availability

*   iOS
*   Android
*   Windows
*   SPA

* * *

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>addDataAt Method</summary>

* * *

Allows you to add one item of data at a given index or with in a section.

### Syntax
```

addDataAt(data,itemIndex,sectionIndex)
```

### Parameters

data

Specifies the JSObject to represent data as key value pairs. The format of the array of data is explained in [data](CollectionView_Properties.md#data) property of collection basic properties.

item data can also have the standard template key to indicate a new template for this added item. However it is developer responsibility to ensure widgetdatamap covers the widgets present in the new template.

itemIndex

Specifies the Index of the item within the section if the _sectionIndex_ is mentioned. If the _sectionIndex_ is not mentioned, the _itemIndex_ is treated in absolute terms independent of sections.

> > **_Note:_** Sections should not be counted as items when calculating the _itemIndex_.

Index is '0' based in JavaScript and should be less than "n", where "n" is the number of existing items within the section if _sectionIndex_ is mentioned. If the _sectionIndex_ is not mentioned "n" is the total number of items in a collection.

If the _itemIndex_ mentioned is greater than "n", then item is added at the end of the collection or at the end of the section depending on the _sectionIndex_.

sectionIndex

Optional. Specifies the Index of the section. If the index is not mentioned, the _itemIndex_ will be treated in absolute terms.

### Remarks

The new data is placed before the index. The existing data is pushed to the next item.

Animations get applied to the items only in the visible region and ignored if the items are in the invisible region.

You can apply specific animations to the displaced items using the [onitemDisplay](#onitemDisplay) method.

The widget/item model will be updated based on the animation fill modes, so that the widget/item would always show the appropriate values. Note that your app must provide itemTemplateId as an empty object in the data object of a item to update the item model

### Example

```

//Sample code to invoke addDataAt method by using a CollectionView widget.  
/*In this example, the data will be added to the second index of the CollectionView widget.*/  
  
var data = [{
    "lbl": "item 0",
    "btn": "Btn item - 0",
    "itemtemplateId": {}
}, {
    "lbl": "Template item 1",
    "img1": "icon.png",
    template: flexTemp2,
    "flexTemp2Id": {}
}, {
    "lbl": "item 2",
    "btn": "Btn item - 2",
    "itemtemplateId": {}
}];  
frmCollection.myCollection.addDataAt(data, 2);  

```

The syntax for the _onGestureClosure_callback function are:

\[function\] - Mandatory

Specifies the function that needs to be executed when a gesture is recognized.

This function will be raised asynchronously and has the following Syntax:

onGestureClosure(widgetRef, gestureInfo, context)

*   widgetRef - specifies the handle to the widget on which the gesture was recognized.
*   gestureInfo - Table with information about the gesture. The contents of this table vary based on the gesture type.
*   context - Table with SegmentedUI row details.

*   sectionIndex \[number\] : section index of the segui where gesture was recognised. (Applicable to gestures added to segUI rows)

It is not recommend to define gestures for widgets that have a default behavior associated with it.

If you click (tap) a button (any clickable widget), the default behavior is to trigger an onClick event. If you define a Tap gesture on such widgets, the gesture closure is executed in addition to the onClick event.

If you swipe a larger form, the default behavior is to scroll up and down depending on the direction in which you swipe. If you define a SWIPE gesture on such forms, the gesture closure gets executed in addition to scrolling the form.

If you swipe a Segmented UI with huge number of rows, the default behavior is to scroll the Segmented UI. If you define a SWIPE gesture on such segments, the gesture closure gets executed in addition to scrolling the form.

Gestures can be added only for the following widgets:

*   Flex Container
    
*   Flex Scroll Container.
    

In the android platform, the top and bottom gestures work only when the scrolling is disabled for Form and parent scrolling containers. By default, the scrolling is enabled for the Form and scrolling containers.

*   RIGHTTAP applicable only to Windows 10
*   ROTATION is not supported on android.

### Example

```

//Sample code to add Gestures to the frmGestures FlexForm.
//Code to add DOUBLE TAP gesture to the frmGestures, FlexForm.
var doubletp = {
 fingers: 1,
 taps: 2
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(1, doubletp, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add SINGLE TAP gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var singleTp = {
 fingers: 1,
 taps: 1
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(1, singleTp, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add SWIPE gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var swipeForm = {
 fingers: 1,
 swipedistance: 50,
 swipevelocity: 75
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(2, swipeForm, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add LONGPRESS gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var longPressForm = {
 pressDuration: 2
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(3, longPressForm, onGestureFunction);

function onGestureFunction(commonWidget, gestureInfo) {
 voltmx.print("The Gesture type is:" + gestureInfo.gestureType);

_widget_

A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

Callback Return Values

  A PreviewInfoTable. See the Remarks section for a description of this table.

### Callback Example

```

function onPeekCallback(widget) {
    var previewInfoTable = {
        "peekForm": frmSecond,
        "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
        "contentSize": [320, 480]
    };
    return previewInfoTable;
}
```

onPopCallback (Optional)

A callback function that is invoked when the user further presses (hard press) the preview that is displayed for the widget.

Callback Syntax

onPopCallback(widget,peekForm)

Callback Input Parameters

_widget_

A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

_peekForm_

A form reference that is displayed as preview/peek.

Callback Return Values

Callback Remarks

Use this callback to set the content for pop. The form handle returned by this callback is used for pop content. In general, the form that is used for preview is used for pop content also. If the pop callback is not implemented, peek disappears and the app returns to its previous state.

### Callback Example

```

function onPopCallback(widget, peekForm) {
    // preview form used for pop also
    return peekForm;
}
```

### Remarks

A PreviewInfoTable has the following format.

**Name:** peekForm

**Description:** The form reference that will be displayed as preview. If an invalid form reference is given, the preview will not be shown.

**Type:** form reference

**Name:** focusRect (Optional)

**Description:** An array representing a rectangle in widgets view coordinates. If provided, this rectangle will be focused while its surrounding area will be blurred, indicating a preview is available for the widget. If not provided, entire view area of the widget will be focused. If either the width or height is zero, the widget's view width/height is used. The values are supported in percentage(with regard to widget bounds), dp, or pixels. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If an array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:** Array \[x, y, width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “0dp”, “200dp”, “300dp”\], \[“10%”, “10%”, “75%”, “50%”\], \[“10px”, “10px”, “200px”, “480px”\]

**Name:** contentSize (Optional)

**Description:** An array representing the preferred content size of the preview. This allows the user to adjust the preferred width/height dimensions of the preview. If not provided, the preview is shown with default values. If either the width or height is zero, the default preview width/height is used. It is recommended that one of the width/height values be zero for proper adjustment of the other value. For example, if width = 0, the height is adjustable and vice versa. Providing positive values simultaneously for both width and height will result in distorted appearance of preview. The values are supported in dp, pixels, and percentage(with regard to screen bounds). The actual width/height of the preview may vary slightly due to resizing per aspect ratio. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:** Array \[width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “100dp”\], \[“100%”, “0%”\], \[“0px”, “240px”\]

### Example of a PreviewInfoTable:

```

var previewInfoTable = {
    "peekForm": frmSecond,
    "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
    "contentSize": [320, 480]

For example, if you specify the text of the badge as 88, the number appears in a rounded rectangular badge. If the length of the badge text is 1, the badge is always a circle. The badge can occupy up to 70% of the width of the parent widget. For example, on a button with a width of 100 pixels, a badge with about 100 characters will occupy only 70 pixels of the button width. The badge text is truncated and shows about 30 characters followed by three dots.

skin \[String\] - Optional

The parameter specifies the background color for the badge. The default color is red.

### Return Values

None

### Exceptions

Error

### Remarks

The color for the badge can be defined using a skin. The default color for the badge is red with white lettering.

If you pass an empty string as a parameter, the badge applied to the widget is cleared.

A Badge can be applied only to the FlexContainer Widget. To apply badge to other widgets, place the corresponding widget inside the FlexContainer, then apply Badge to the FlexContainer Widget. Also make sure that the clipBounds property of the FlexContainer are set to false.

If the badge value is a single character (a character or a number), the badge shape is a circle.

![](Resources/Images/widgetbadge.png)

If the badge value contains multiple characters, the badge shape is a rectangle with rounded corners and borders.

The badge can occupy a maximum of 70% width of the parent widget (widget on which badge is applied). For example, on a button with a width of 100 pixels, a badge with about 100 characters will occupy only 70 pixels of the button width. The badge value is truncated and about 30 characters followed by three dots.

When a badge is set, the widgets are re-arranged to accommodate the badge.

For iOS platform, this method is applicable on Box, Label, and Image widgets only.

For Android platform, this method is applicable on Button and Image widgets only.

### Example

```

//This is a generic method that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the setBadge Method for button widget.
//You need to make a corresponding call of the setBadge method for other applicable widgets.
function setBadge() {
    /*To set a badge value with skin "badgeSkin" on a button btn1
placed on a form frm1, use the following code: */
    frm1.btn1.setBadge("2", "badgeSkin");
}
//For instance, the corresponding setEnabled method call on the Label widget is as follows:
form.lbl1.setBadge("4", "badgeSkin");
```

### Platform Availability

<details close markdown="block"><summary>setData Method</summary>

* * *

This method allows you to set new data to the collection.

### Syntax
```

setData(data)
```

### Parameters

data

Specifies an array to represent data as key value pairs. The format of the array of data is explained in [data](CollectionView_Properties.md#data) property of collection basic properties.

### Remarks

When you set new data, the existing data will be replaced with the new data. If the collection has no data, the new data is placed in the collection.

Updating a widget's data using the setData method as part of its own callbacks in a item's context results undefined behaviour.

### Example

```

//Sample code to invoke the setData method by using a CollectionView widget.  
  
frmCollection.myCollection.setData(
    [{
        dataId1: "data1",
        dataId2: "data2",
        dataId3: "data3"
    }, {
        dataId1: "datax",
        dataId2: "datay",
        dataId3: "dataz",
        template: box1
    }]
);

```

### Platform Availability

<details close markdown="block"><summary>setDataAt Method</summary>

* * *

Allows you to set data or modify existing data of a item or within a section.

### Syntax
```

setDataAt(data,itemIndex,sectionIndex)
```

### Parameters

data

Specifies the JSObject to represent data as key value pairs. The format of the array of data is explained in [data](CollectionView_Properties.md#data) property of collection basic properties. itemdata can have the standard template key to indicate a new template for this item. However it is developer responsibility to ensure widgetDataMap covers the widgets present in the new template.

itemIndex

Specifies the Index of the item within the section if the _sectionIndex_ is mentioned. If the _sectionIndex_ is not mentioed, the _itemIndex_ is treated in absolute terms independent of sections.

> > **_Note:_** Sections should not be counted as items when calculating the _itemIndex_.

Index is '0' based in JavaScript and should be less than "n", where "n" is the number of existing items within the section if _sectionIndex_ is mentioned. If the _sectionIndex_ is not mentioned "n" is the total number of items in a collection.

If the itemIndex mentioned is not within the limits then no action takes place.

sectionIndex

Optional. Specifies the Index of the section. If the index is not mentioned, the _itemIndex_ will be treated in absolute terms.

### Remarks

The existing data of the item will be replaced with the new set. In case the index is not valid and not falling in range 0 <= index <= N, where N is the total number of records then the operation is ignored.

### Example

```

//Sample code to invoke the setDataAt method by using a CollectionView widget.  
  
var data = [{
 "lbl": "item 0",
 "btn": "Btn item - 0",
 "itemtemplateId": {}
}, {
 "lbl": "Template item 1",

<details close markdown="block"><summary>setOnPeek Method</summary>

* * *

This method sets and overrides the existing onPeekCallback for the widget.

### Syntax
```

setOnPeek(onPeekCallback)
```

### Parameters

onPeekCallback

A callback function that is invoked when the user slightly presses (soft press) the widget.

Callback Syntax

onPeekCallback(widget)

Callback Parameters

_widget_

A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

Callback Return Values

PreviewInfoTable. See the Remarks section for a description of this table.

### Callback Example

```

function onPeekCallback(widget, contextInfo) {
    var previewInfoTable = {
        "peekForm": frmSecond,
        "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
        "contentSize": [320, 480]
    };
    return previewInfoTable;
}
```

Return Values

None.

### Remarks

A PreviewInfoTable has the following format.

**Name:** peekForm

**Description:** The form reference that will be displayed as preview. If an invalid form reference is given, the preview will not be shown.

**Type:** form reference

**Name:** focusRect (Optional)

**Description:** An array representing a rectangle in widgets view coordinates. If provided, this rectangle will be focused while its surrounding area will be blurred, indicating a preview is available for the widget. If not provided, entire view area of the widget will be focused. If either the width or height is zero, the widget's view width/height is used. The values are supported in percentage(with regard to widget bounds), dp, or pixels. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If an array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:**Array \[x, y, width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “0dp”, “200dp”, “300dp”\], \[“10%”, “10%”, “75%”, “50%”\], \[“10px”, “10px”, “200px”, “480px”\]

**Name:**contentSize (Optional)

**Description:**An array representing the preferred content size of the preview. This allows the user to adjust the preferred width/height dimensions of the preview. If not provided, the preview is shown with default values. If either the width or height is zero, the default preview width/height is used. It is recommended that one of the width/height values be zero for proper adjustment of the other value. For example, if width = 0, the height is adjustable and vice versa. Providing positive values simultaneously for both width and height will result in distorted appearance of preview. The values are supported in dp, pixels, and percentage(with regard to screen bounds). The actual width/height of the preview may vary slightly due to resizing per aspect ratio. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:**Array \[width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “100dp”\], \[“100%”, “0%”\], \[“0px”, “240px”\]

### Example of a PreviewInfoTable:

```

var previewInfoTable = {
    "peekForm": frmSecond,
    "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
    "contentSize": [320, 480]
};
```

### Example

```

function settingPeek() {
    Form1.setOnPeek(onMyPeekcallback);
}

function onMyPeekcallback(widgetref, contextInfo) {
    if (typeof(contextInfo) === undefined) {
        return null;
    }

    var previewInfoTable = {
        "peekForm": frmSecond,
        "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
        "contentSize": [320, 480]
    };
