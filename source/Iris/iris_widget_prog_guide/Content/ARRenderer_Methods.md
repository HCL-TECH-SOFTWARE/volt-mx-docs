### The syntax for the _onGestureClosure_callback function are:

\[function\] - Mandatory

Specifies the function that needs to be executed when a gesture is recognized.

### This function will be raised asynchronously and has the following Syntax:

onGestureClosure(widgetRef, gestureInfo, context)

*   widgetRef - specifies the handle to the widget on which the gesture was recognized.
*   gestureInfo - Table with information about the gesture. The contents of this table vary based on the gesture type.
*   context - Table with SegmentedUI row details.

gestureInfo table has the following key-value pairs:

*   sectionIndex \[number\] : section index of the segui where gesture was recognised. (Applicable to gestures added to segUI rows)

It is not recommend to define gestures for widgets that have a default behavior associated with it.

If you click (tap) a button (any clickable widget), the default behavior is to trigger an onClick event. If you define a Tap gesture on such widgets, the gesture closure is executed in addition to the onClick event.

If you swipe a larger form, the default behavior is to scroll up and down depending on the direction in which you swipe. If you define a SWIPE gesture on such forms, the gesture closure gets executed in addition to scrolling the form.

If you swipe a Segmented UI with huge number of rows, the default behavior is to scroll the Segmented UI. If you define a SWIPE gesture on such segments, the gesture closure gets executed in addition to scrolling the form.

### Gestures can be added only for the following widgets:

*   Flex Container
    
*   Flex Scroll Container.
    

In the android platform, the top and bottom gestures work only when the scrolling is disabled for Form and parent scrolling containers. By default, the scrolling is enabled for the Form and scrolling containers.

*   RIGHTTAP applicable only to Windows 10
*   ROTATION is not supported on android.

### Example

```
 
//Sample code to add Gestures to the frmGestures FlexForm.
//Code to add DOUBLE TAP gesture to the frmGestures, FlexForm.
var doubletp = {
 fingers: 1,
 taps: 2
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(1, doubletp, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add SINGLE TAP gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var singleTp = {
 fingers: 1,
 taps: 1
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(1, singleTp, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add SWIPE gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var swipeForm = {
 fingers: 1,
 swipedistance: 50,
 swipevelocity: 75
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(2, swipeForm, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add LONGPRESS gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var longPressForm = {
 pressDuration: 2
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(3, longPressForm, onGestureFunction);

function onGestureFunction(commonWidget, gestureInfo) {
 voltmx.print("The Gesture type is:" + gestureInfo.gestureType);

}
