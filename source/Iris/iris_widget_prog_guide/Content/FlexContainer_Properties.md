========================

The properties for FlexContainer widget are as follows.

* * *


<details close markdown="block"><summary>accessibilityConfig Property</summary>

* * *

Enables you to control accessibility behavior and alternative text for the widget.

For more information on using accessibility features in your app, see the [Accessibility](../../../Iris/app_design_dev/Content/Accessibility_Overview.md) appendix in the Volt MX IrisUser Guide.

### Syntax 

```

accessibilityConfig
```

### Type

Object

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   The accessibilityConfig property is enabled for all the widgets which are supported under the Flex Layout.

> **_Note:_** From Volt MX Iris V9 SP2 GA version, you can provide i18n keys as values to all the attributes used inside the `accessibilityConfig` property. Values provided in the i18n keys take precedence over values provided in `a11yLabel`, `a11yValue`, and `a11yHint` fields.

The accessibilityConfig property is a JavaScript object which can contain the following key-value pairs.

  
| Key | Type | Description | ARIA Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a11yIndex | Integer with no floating or decimal number. | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the order in which the widgets are focused on a screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-index`, `index`, or `taborder` properties. |
| a11yLabel | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies alternate text to identify the widget. Generally the label should be the text that is displayed on the screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-labelledby` property of ARIA in HTML. > **_Note:_** For the Image widget, this parameter maps to the **alt** attribute of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yValue | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | This parameter is similar to the a11yLabel parameter. If the a11yValue is defined, the value of a11yValue is appended to the value of a11yLabel. These values are separated by a space. |
| a11yHint | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-describedby` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yHidden | Boolean | This is an optional parameter. Specifies if the widget should be ignored by assistive technology. The default option is set to _false_. This option is supported on iOS 5.0 and above, Android 4.1 and above, and SPA | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-hidden` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yARIA | Object | This is an optional parameter. For each widget, the key and value provided in this object are added as the attribute and value of the HTML tags respectively. Any values provided for attributes such as `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` using this attribute, takes precedence over values given in `a11yLabel` and `a11yHint` fields. When a widget is provided with the following key value pair or attribute using the a11yARIA object, the tabIndex of the widget is automatically appended as zero.`{"role": "main"}``aria-label` | This parameter is only available on the Desktop Web platform. |

### Android limitations

*   If the results of the concatenation of a11y fields result in an empty string, then `accessibilityConfig` is ignored and the text that is on widget is read out.
*   The soft keypad does not gain accessibility focus during the right/left swipe gesture when the keypad appears.

### SPA/Desktop Web limitations

*   When `accessibilityConfig` property is configured for any widget, the `tabIndex` attribute is added automatically to the `accessibilityConfig` property.
*   The behavior of accessibility depends on the Web browser, Web browser version, Voice Over Assistant, and Voice Over Assistant version.
*   Currently SPA/Desktop web applications support only a few ARIA tags. To achieve more accessibility features, use the attribute a11yARIA. The corresponding tags will be added to the DOM as per these configurations.

### Example 1

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have an accessibilityConfig property.

```
//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the accessibilityConfig Property for button widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the accessibilityConfig property for other applicable widgets.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "Label",
    "a11yValue": "Value",
    "a11yHint": "Hint"    
};
```

### Example 2

This example uses the button widget to implement internationalization in `accessibilityConfig` property, but the principle remains the same for all widgets.

```
/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Native platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString("key1")     
};  
/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Desktop Web platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString(\"key3\")"
};
```

### Platform Availability

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>a11yNavigationMode</summary> 

* * *

The property helps to specify the type of navigation order that should be used in the FlexContainer.

### Syntax 

```

a11yNavigationMode
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

You can define any one of the following values to the property:

*   constants.ACCESSIBILITY\_NAVIGATION\_MODE\_NATIVE: Native accessibility navigation. Applies the platform's default accessibility navigation order. This is the default value for the property.
*   constants.ACCESSIBILITY\_NAVIGATION\_MODE\_PARENT: Applies a custom navigation for widgets based on the a11yIndices set to the child widgets.
*   constants.ACCESSIBILITY\_NAVIGATION\_MODE\_DEFAULT: Derives the property value from its immediate parent going all the way to form level.

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the a11yNavigationMode property to a FlexContainer widget.

myForm.myFlexContainer.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yNavigationMode": constants.ACCESSIBILITY_NAVIGATION_PARENT   
};
```

### Availability

iOS

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>anchorPoint Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the anchor point of the widget bounds rectangle using the widget's coordinate space.

### Syntax 

```

anchorPoint
```

### Type

JSObject

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The value for this property is a JavaScript dictionary object with the keys "x" and "y". The values for the "x" and "y" keys are floating-point numbers ranging from 0 to 1. All geometric manipulations to the widget occur about the specified point. For example, applying a rotation transform to a widget with the default anchor point causes the widget to rotate around its center.

The default value for this property is center ( {"x":0.5, "y":0.5} ), that represents the center of the widgets bounds rectangle. The behavior is undefined if the values are outside the range zero (0) to one (1).

### Example

```
Form1.widget1.anchorPoint = {
    "x": 0.5,
    "y": 0.5
};
```

### Platform Availability

*   iOS, Android, Windows, and SPA

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>autogrowMode Property (Deprecated)</summary>

* * *

This property is enables you to grow the height of the FlexContainer when child widgets or content is added on the FlexContainer. The options are:

The autogrowMode property is used to set the height of a widget dynamically based on the derived height of the widget’s content, or from the child widget’s contents. The options are:

*   voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_NONE (value is 0)
*   voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT (value is 1)

### Syntax 

```

autogrowMode
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read only

### Remarks

> **_Note:_** If you want to configure this property in Volt MX Iris, configure the height property of FlexContainer as preferred, then Volt MX Iris generates the autogrowMode property as voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT.

The default value for this property is voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_NONE.

> **_Note:_** If one or all the child widgets height or other properties such as centerY, top, bottom, minHeight or maxHeight are used in determining the height given in percentage (%), then the autogrowMode property will not work for the FlexContainer and its height fallback to default configuration value.

### Rules and priorities of autogrowMode property

*   The autogrowMode property is ignored if the height of the widget is computable either through explicit value or implicit calculation.
    
*   If the autogrowMode property is configured as voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT, then preferredSize (based on content or child widgets ) is computed, and min/max constraints are applied.
*   If the autogrowMode property is configured as voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_NONE, the default value is applied with min/max constraints.
*   The height of a FlexContainer widget will not grow dynamically if the height of any widget changes because of the change in widget's skin state (such as from normal to focus).
*   If a widgets top value is given in negative values, then the widget is clipped in case of Free Form and overlapped on the previous widget in case of Flow Vertical.
*   The autogrowMode property is not supported for a FlexContainer widget that is placed inside an HBox or a VBox.
*   For example, a FlexContainer (flexA) has a FlexContainer (flexB), which is not set to grow dynamically, whose clipBounds is set to false. The children of flexB that are out of the bounds of flexB do not have any effect on the height of flexA. Only the heights of direct children of flexA will decide the height of flexA.
*   In templates, FlexContainer will grow only in SegmentedUI Table View only. In all other views, autogrowMode property is not supported.
*   The autogrowMode property for a FlexContainer is not supported in the Tab Widget.
*   In the Windows platform, the autogrowMode property of a SegmentedUI is not supported inside a FlexContainer.
*   The autogrowMode property of a SegmentedUI with a large number of rows leads to performance and memory issues.
*   Excessive usage of auto grow flex containers inside a form will impact the performance of the application.
*   Rendering of widgets with preferred height or preferred width will take more time in mobile and tablet browsers compared to desktop browsers.
*   When animating the height property of the child widget of a FlexContainer in iOS, Windows, and SPA platforms, after the animation is complete, then parent containers height increases based on the value provided in 100th step when fillMode is configured as voltmx.anim.FILL\_MODE\_FORWARDS.
*   When animating the height property of the child widget of a FlexContainer in the Android platform, the parent container's height grows along with the child widget's height.

### When to Use

Case1: If the height of the FlexContainer is dependent on the heights of the child widgets that are added.

Case2: If you are using the FlexContainer in a SegmentedUI template, where each row of the SegmentedUI row height is dependent on the child widgets content. Configure the height property of the FlexContainer as preferred, then Volt MX Iris generates the autogrowMode property as voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW\_HEIGHT.

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the autogrowMode property of a FlexContainer widget.
//Here, flexcontainer1 FlexContainer retains the height given in the height Property.
frmHome.flexcontainer1.autogrowMode=voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW_NONE;

//Here, flexcontainer1 FlexContainer uses the child widget content to determine its height.
frmHome.flexcontainer1.autogrowMode=voltmx.flex.AUTOGROW_HEIGHT;
```

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>backgroundColor Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the background color of the widget.

### Syntax 

```

backgroundColor
```

### Type

Color constant or Hexadecimal number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   The initial value of backgroundColor has to be specified explicitly. If not, Iris will not deduce the values from the existing skin and this will lead to undefined behavior.
*   Colors can be specified using a 6 digit or an 8-digit hex value with alpha position. For example, ffff65 or ffffff00.
*   When the 4-byte color format (RGBA) string is used, an alpha (A) value of 65 specifies that the color is transparent. If the value is 00, the color is opaque. The Alpha value is in percentage and must be given in the hexadecimal value for the color (100% in hexadecimal value is 65).  
    For example, red complete opaque is FF000000. Red complete transparent is FF000065. The values 0x and # are not allowed in the string.
*   A color constant is a String that is defined at the theme level. Ensure that you append the **$** symbol at the beginning of the color constant.
*   This property does not have a default value.
*   This property has more priority than (and overrides) the background property of the configured skin. Even if there is no skin configured for the widget, this property updates the skin.
*   The backgroundColor, backgroundColorTwoStepGradient, backgroundColoMultiStepGradient, and backgroundImage properties are mutually exclusive. The property that was set most recently is given higher priority over other properties.

### Example

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have the backgroundColor property.

```
Form1.btn1.backgroundColor = "ea5075";

```

### Platform Availability

*   Android
*   iOS
*   Desktop Web (Not available on Desktop Web Legacy SDK)

<details close markdown="block"><summary>blur Property</summary>

* * *

You can enable or disable a blur-effect for a widget(for example, a FlexContainer) by making use of a constructor-level property, called **blur**. The **blur** property accepts a dictionary that contains the following keys: enabled, value and style. You must specify an appropriate value for the dictionary keys, otherwise the property will not be valid.

### Syntax 

```

blur
```

**### Input Parameters**

*   _enabled_: Accepts a Boolean value that basically decides whether to enable or disable the blur-effect for the widget. This is a mandatory attribute.
*   _value_: Level of the blur-effect that needs to be set for the widget. It should ideally be between 0 to 100. If the level is set as 0 no blur is set, even when the enabled property is set as true. This is a mandatory attribute. Even when the _enabled_ attribute is set as false, you need to specify a numerical value to this attribute.
    
*   _style_: Specifies the style in which the blur property can be applied to a widget. This is an optional parameter specific to iOS. The default value of this parameter is constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_LIGHT. You can specify any of the following values to this parameter:  
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_NONE
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_EXTRALIGHT
        
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_LIGHT (default)
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_DARK
        
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_REGULAR
        
    *   constants.BLUR\_EFFECT\_PROMINENT
        

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   If you set _enabled_ as true, the blur-effect for the widget is enabled.
*   If you set _enabled_ as false, the blur-effect for the widget is disabled.
*   If you specify _value_ as less than 0, the value is taken as 0.
    
*   If you specify _value_ as greater than 100, the value is taken as 100.

### Limitations

*   For Android:
    *   If a FlexContainer or a FlexScrollContainer contains a Map widget, the blur-effect is not applied to the map.
        
    *   If a FlexContainer or a FlexScrollContainer contains a Browser or Video widget, the blur-effect is applied but does not get updated. For example, when the video starts playing, the new rendered frame does not get displayed with the blur-effect.
        
    *   Even if you apply 100% blur for widgets that display any text( such as Label or Calendar widgets), the text on these widgets is not blurred. This is a Native Android limitation. To generate the blur effect for the text, apply a skin with darker background to the Label or Calendar widget. This is true even when the widgets are placed in a FlexContainer with blur effect and the widgets do not have a skin.
    *   Blur effect will not work on widgets added inside BOX containers.

### Example 1

To dynamically set the blur-effect for any widget, such as a FlexContainer, use the following code.

```
//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the blur property for FlexContainer widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the 
blur property for other applicable widgets.*/

Form1.myFlexContainer.blur = {
    "enabled": true,
    "value": 60
};

```

### Example 2

To dynamically set the blur-effect for any widget, such as a FlexContainer in iOS, use the following code.

```
Form1.widget1.blur = {
    "enabled": true,
    "value": 60,
    "style": constants.BLUR_EFFECT_DARK
};
```

### Remarks

*   Colors can be specified using a 6 digit or an 8-digit hex value with alpha position. For example, ffff65 or ffffff00.
*   When the 4-byte color format (RGBA) string is used, an alpha (A) value of 65 specifies that the color is transparent. If the value is 00, the color is opaque. The Alpha value is in percentage and must be given in the hexadecimal value for the color (100% in hexadecimal value is 65).  
    For example, red complete opaque is FF000000. Red complete transparent is FF000065. The values 0x and # are not allowed in the string.

_VIEW\_CLIP\_SHAPE\_RECTANGLE_: The widget view is rectangle. By default, the value is set.

_VIEW\_CLIP\_SHAPE\_ROUNDED\_RECTANGLE_: The widget view is rectangle with rounded corners.

_VIEW\_CLIP\_SHAPE\_CIRCLE_: The widget view is circular.

**bounds**

Optional. A key-value pair represents the bounds of the shape to clip a view. Specify the bounds as an array of integers \[left, top, right, bottom\].

**boundsInPixel**

Optional. Defines whether the units of specified bounds should be in pixels or in percentage. The property takes the Boolean value.

_true_: Indicates the specified bounds should be in pixels.

_false_: Indicates the specified bounds should be in percentage.

**radius**

### Remarks

The default value for this property is voltmx.flex.FREE\_FORM.

> **_Note:_** This property can only be set during widget construction.

The available options are:

*   `voltmx.flex.FREE_FORM`: The calculations for free form layout type are:  
    *   left is measured from the left bounds of the parent, right is measured from the right bounds of the parent and centerX measured from the left bounds of the parent.
    *   top is measured from the top bounds of the parent, bottom is measured from the bottom bounds of the parent and centerY measured from the bop bounds of the parent.
    *   For x-axis values are width, left, right, centerX in case of % units are relative to parent's width.
    *   For y-axis values are height, top, bottom, centerY in case of % units are relative to parent's height.
*   `voltmx.flex.FLOW_HORIZONTAL`: The calculations for horizontal layout type are:  
    *   left is measured from right edge of the left sibling widget and right is measured from the left edge of the right sibling widget.
    *   horizontal space between two widgets is right of the left sibling widget + left of the right sibling widget.
    *   order of the widgets appearing in the flow is the order in which the widgets are added.
    *   top and bottom properties are measured from the boundaries of the parent.
*   `voltmx.flex.FLOW_VERTICAL`: The calculations for vertical layout type are:  
      
    *   top is measured from bottom edge of the top sibling widget and bottom is measured from the top edge of bottom sibling widget.
    *   vertical space between two widgets is bottom of the top sibling widget + top of the bottom sibling widget.
    *   order of the widgets appearing in the flow is the order in which the widgets are added.
    *   left and right properties are measured from the boundaries of the parent.
*   `voltmx.flex.RESPONSIVE_GRID`: When you assign the value of the layoutType property as `voltmx.flex.RESPONSIVE_GRID`, you can assign different layouts for different breakpoints. Here are the some of the things to consider when you assign the Responsive Grid layout.  
    *   Widgets are aligned from left to right with the span and offset values provided in the Look tab of the Properties panel.
    *   You can only provide FlexContainer widget as the direct child after assigning this value to the parent.
    *   The FlexContainer cell respects height, minHeight, maxHeight property only.
    *   If the width of a child widget exceeds the width of the container widget, the next child widget is wrapped and placed in the next row.

<details close markdown="block"><summary>reverseLayoutDirection Property</summary>

* * *

The _reverseLayoutDirection_ property specifies the stacking order of the child widgets of FlexContainer. It is not applicable when the value of the [layout### Type](#layoutTy) Property is _voltmx.flex.FREE\_FORM_.

The default value of the property is false.

### Syntax 

```

reverseLayoutDirection
```

### Type

Boolean

### Read / Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

1.  If the value of _reverseLayoutDirection_ property is set as false:
    *   When the value of _layoutType_ property is, voltmx.flex.FLOW\_HORIZONTAL, the child widgets are stacked from left to right.
    *   When the value of _layoutType_ property is, voltmx.flex.FLOW\_VERTICAL, the child widgets are stacked from top to bottom.
2.  If the value of _reverseLayoutDirection_ property is set as true:
    *   When the value of _layoutType_ property is, voltmx.flex.FLOW\_HORIZONTAL, the child widgets are stacked from right to left.
    *   When the value of _layoutType_ property is, voltmx.flex.FLOW\_VERTICAL, the child widgets are stacked from bottom to top.

### Limitations

*   When the value of _reverseLayoutDirection_ property is true, the frame values of the child widgets are calculated with respect to the [left](FlexScrollContainer_Properties.md#left) property of FlexContainer. The frame values given for different features of FlexContainer widget, such as animation, must reflect this change.

### Example

You can change the flow layout direction of a FlexContainer with ID as "flexContainer1" in form "myForm" during run time by entering the following code.

```
//Sample code to enable reverseLayoutDirection property for a FlexContainer widget. myForm.myFlexContainer.reverseLayoutDirection = true;

**contentLayers**

Optional. Array of two JS Objects. Each JS Object contains following key-value pairs to define a layer for ripple background. You can define the background for the ripple as a skin or as a background color.

#### background

Defines the background for the ripples. You can define the color in the RGBA format, where the R, G, and B range from 00 to ff, and the A (transparency) ranges from 00 (zero percent) to 64 (100 percent). Or, you can specify a skin as the background.

#### backgroundType

Defines the type of a background. You can define:

_RIPPLE\_CONTENT\_LAYER\_COLOR_: Background as color in the RGBA format.

_RIPPLE\_CONTENT\_LAYER\_SKIN_: Background as a skin.

#### Mask

Defines the bounds for the ripple animation. The property takes the Boolean value and by default is set to false.

#### padding

Defines the space around the ripple background. Specify an array of four integers \[left, top, right, bottom\]

#### paddingInPixel

Defines whether the units of specified padding values should be in pixels or in percentage. The property takes the Boolean value.

_true_: Indicates the specified padding values should be in pixels.

_false_: Indicates the specified padding values should be in percentage.

**paddingMode**

Optional. Defines how layer padding should affect the bounds of subsequent layers. You can define:

_RIPPLE\_PADDING\_MODE\_NEST_: Nests each layer inside padding of the previous layer.

_RIPPLE\_PADDING\_MODE\_STACK_: Stacks each layer on top of the previous layer. This is the default value.

### Read/Write

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the rippleBackground property for a FlexContainer widget. 
myForm.myFlexContainer.rippleBackground = {
 rippleColor: "ffff0000",
 contentLayers: [{
  background: "ffffff00",
  backgroundType: constants.RIPPLE_CONTENT_LAYER_COLOR,
  mask: false,
  padding: [10, 10, 10, 10]

### Remarks

*   For a Segment, the **widgetSwipeMove** Property is configured while setting the data of the Segment.

> **_Note:_** It is not recommended to assign the widgetSwipeMove property on a top Flex container of the segment template widget.

### Limitations

*   When a translation animation is applied to the same widget that has **widgetSwipeMove** already configured, the action which has been performed last takes precedence. For example, if you have set a translation animation on a FlexContainer and then set the _widgetSwipeMove_ property, the actions set in _widgetSwipeMove_ take precedence over the translation animation.
*   The state of the swipe transition of the widget is not retained.
*   In a Segment, the _widgetSwipeMove_ Property must be configured for the rows so that they reset to the previous position.

*   If the widgetSwipeMove property is configured on a top level Flex container of a segment template, the onRowClick event will not be triggered. - Applicable on iOS, Android, and SPA.
*   Android limitation: On Android devices, when the user lifts their finger, the transition occurs immediately.

### Example

Following is a code snippet for a mail app. Here we have used a Segment for listing the mail and the _widgetSwipeMove_ Property has been configured for the _SwipeFlex_ FlexContainer.

```
//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.  
//Here, we have shown how to use the widetSwipeMove property for Button widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the 
widgetSwipeMove property for other applicable widgets.*/  
//### Example of a swipe move configuration.  
var swipeMoveConfig = {
 "translate": true,
 "Xboundaries": ["-60%", "60%"],
 "swipeLeft": [{
  "translateRange": ["-60%", "0%"],
  "callback": null,
  "translatePos": "-60%",
  "translate": true
 }, {
  "translateRange": ["0%", "60%"],
  "callback": null,
  "translatePos": "0%",
  "translate": true
 }],
 "swipeRight": [{
  "translateRange": ["-60%", "0%"],
  "callback": null,
  "translatePos": "0%",
  "translate": true
 }, {
  "translateRange": ["0%", "60%"],
  "callback": this.onCallback1,
  "translatePos": "60%",
  "translate": true
 }]
};  
  
this.view.myButton.widgetSwipeMove=swipeMoveConfig;  

```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>width Property</summary>

* * *

This property determines the width of the widget and is measured along the x-axis.

The width property determines the width of the widget’s bounding box. The value may be set using DP (Device Independent Pixels), Percentage, or Pixels. For supported widgets, the width may be derived from either the widget or container’s contents by setting the width to “preferred”.

### Syntax 

```

width
```

### Type

Number, String, and Constant

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

Following are the options that can be used as units of width:

*   %: Specifies the values in percentage relative to the parent dimensions.
*   px: Specifies the values in terms of device hardware pixels.
*   dp: Specifies the values in terms of device independent pixels.
*   default: Specifies the default value of the widget.
*   voltmx.flex.USE\_PREFERED\_SIZE: When this option is specified, the layout uses preferred width of the widget as width and preferred size of the widget is determined by the widget and may varies between platforms.

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the width property for widgets by using DP, Percentage and Pixels.
frmHome.widgetID.width = "50dp";

frmHome.widgetID.width = "10%";

frmHome.widgetID.width = "10px";
```

### Platform Availability

*   Available in the IDE
*   iOS, Android, Windows, SPA, and Desktop Web

<details close markdown="block"><summary>zIndex Property</summary>

This property specifies the stack order of a widget. A widget with a higher zIndex is always in front of a widget with a lower zIndex.

The zIndex property is used to set the stack, or layer order of a widget. Widgets with higher values will appear “over”, or “on top of” widgets with lower values. Widgets layered over other widgets will override any interaction events tied to widgets beneath. Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets in the Volt MX Iris hierarchy, inside of a flexContainer or form. The zIndex property accepts only positive values.

### Syntax 

```

zIndex
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The default value for this property is 1.

> **_Note:_** Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets inside the FlexContainer. If zIndex is same for group of overlapping widgets then widget order decides the order of overlapping. The last added widget is displayed on top.

From Volt MX Iris V9 SP2 FP7, developers can configure the Z Index value for a Responsive Web app as **Auto** or **Custom**. When the selected Z Index value is **Auto**, the default Z Index value of 1 is applied. When the selected Z Index value is **Custom**, developers can specify a desired numeric value.

Prior to the V9 SP2 FP7 release, the default value for the Z Index was **1**. When developers imported any third-party libraries with the Z index set as **Auto**, content overflow was disabled as the value of Auto is less than 1.

> **_Note:_** The Z Index value Auto is supported only when the Enable JS Library mode is configured as unchecked.

For existing components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Custom** with **1** as the value.

For new components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Auto** or **1** based on the project level settings.

> **_Note:_** If ModalContainer property is set to true in any of the FlexContainer widget, the Z Index value of that container and all of its parent containers should be set to **Custom**.

**voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO** : Constant to configure the Z Index value as **auto** programmatically.

```
//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto  
 var flx = new voltmx.ui.FlexContainer({ 
  "id": "flx"
  "zIndex": voltmx.flex.ZINDEX_AUTO
});

```
```
//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto
flx.zIndex = voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO;

```

### Example

```
//Sample code to set the zIndex property for widgets.  
frmHome.widgetID.zIndex = 300;
```
