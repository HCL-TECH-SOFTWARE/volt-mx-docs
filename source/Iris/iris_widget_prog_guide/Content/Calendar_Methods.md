================

Calendar has the following methods associated with it:

<details close markdown="block"><summary>animate Method</summary>

* * *

Applies an animation to the widget.

### Syntax

```

animate (animationObj, animateConfig, animationCallbacks)
```

### Parameters

_animationObj_

An `animation` object created using [voltmx.ui.createAnimation](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/voltmx.ui_functions.md#createAn) function.

_animationConfig_

As defined in widget level animation section.

_animationCallbacks_

A JavaScript dictionary that contains key-value pairs. The following keys are supported.

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| animationEnd | A JavaScript function that is invoked with the animation ends. For more information, see the **Remarks** section below. |
| animationStart | A JavaScript function that is invoked with the animation starts. For more information, see the **Remarks** section below. |

### Return Values

Returns a platform-specific handle to the animation. This handle currently not used, but is returned for possible future requirements use.

### Remarks

The callback for the `animationStart` key in the JavaScript object passed in this method's _animationCallbacks_ parameter has the following signature.

animationStart(source, animationHandle, elapsedTime);

where `source` is the widget being animated, `animationHandle` is the handle returned by the `applyAnimation` method, and `elapsedTime` is the amount of time the animation has been running in seconds, when this event is fired..

This event occurs at the start of the animation. If there is 'animation-delay' configured then this event will fire only after the delay period. This event gets called asynchronously.

The callback for the `animationEnd` key in the JavaScript object passed in this method's _animationCallbacks_ parameter has the following signature.

animationEnd(source, animationHandle, elapsedTime);

where source is the widget being animated, animationHandle is the handle returned by the applyAnimation method, and elapsedTime is the amount of time the animation has been running in seconds, when this event is fired.

This event occurs at the end of the animation. This event gets called asynchronously.

The `animate` method throws an Invalid Animation Definition Exception if animation definition, does not follow the dictionary structure expected. This method is ignored if it is called on a widget whose immediate parent is not FlexContainer or a FlexScrollContainer.

If the widget is not part of the currently visible view hierarchy, calling this method does nothing. Because this method is asynchronous and immediately returns, it does not wait for the animation to start or complete.

### Example

```

//Sample code of animation
function AnimateBoth() {
    var getFuncName = frm1.listbox18.selectedKey;
    if (getFuncName == "BothLT") {
        frm1.textbox26.animate(myAnimDefinition(),
            animConfiguration(), {});
    } else if (getFuncName == "BothTBL") {
        frm1.textbox26.animate(myAnimDefinitionsc1(),
            animConfiguration(), {});
    }
}
```

*   sectionIndex \[number\] : section index of the segui where gesture was recognised. (Applicable to gestures added to segUI rows)

It is not recommend to define gestures for widgets that have a default behavior associated with it.

If you click (tap) a button (any clickable widget), the default behavior is to trigger an onClick event. If you define a Tap gesture on such widgets, the gesture closure is executed in addition to the onClick event.

If you swipe a larger form, the default behavior is to scroll up and down depending on the direction in which you swipe. If you define a SWIPE gesture on such forms, the gesture closure gets executed in addition to scrolling the form.

If you swipe a Segmented UI with huge number of rows, the default behavior is to scroll the Segmented UI. If you define a SWIPE gesture on such segments, the gesture closure gets executed in addition to scrolling the form.

### Gestures can be added only for the following widgets:

*   Flex Container
    
*   Flex Scroll Container.
    

In the android platform, the top and bottom gestures work only when the scrolling is disabled for Form and parent scrolling containers. By default, the scrolling is enabled for the Form and scrolling containers.

*   RIGHTTAP applicable only to Windows 10
*   ROTATION is not supported on android.

### Example

```

//Sample code to add Gestures to the frmGestures FlexForm.
//Code to add DOUBLE TAP gesture to the frmGestures, FlexForm.
var doubletp = {
 fingers: 1,
 taps: 2
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(1, doubletp, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add SINGLE TAP gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var singleTp = {
 fingers: 1,
 taps: 1
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(1, singleTp, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add SWIPE gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var swipeForm = {
 fingers: 1,
 swipedistance: 50,
 swipevelocity: 75
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(2, swipeForm, onGestureFunction);
//Code to add LONGPRESS gesture to the frmGestures FlexForm.
var longPressForm = {
 pressDuration: 2
};
frmGestures.addGestureRecognizer(3, longPressForm, onGestureFunction);

function onGestureFunction(commonWidget, gestureInfo) {
 voltmx.print("The Gesture type is:" + gestureInfo.gestureType);

<details close markdown="block"><summary>clone Method</summary>

* * *

When this method is used on a container widget, then all the widgets inside the container are cloned. This method takes an optional parameter. If the widgetid is not passed then the cloned copy will have the same ID as original widget.

If the widget ID is passed as a parameter then it will be prefixed to the existing ID and will assign it to cloned copy of the container. For all other widgets of the container and its child widgets.

For example, if the widget ID is "fc1" and the widget ID passed to clone API is "ref1", then the cloned widget ID will be "ref1fc1". For a child widget placed in a container with widget ID as "wid1", the cloned copy will have the widget ID as "ref1wid1".

Exceptions are not displayed if widget ID parameter is not unique. Instead when the cloned copy is added to the same form as of original container then it may lead to unexpected behaviors. So it is your responsibility to provide unique widget ID.

### Syntax

```

clone()
```

### Parameters

widgetId \[String\]

Optional. Reference of the name of the widget.

### Return Values

Cloned copy of the widget.

### Exceptions

None

This method registers a widget to enable 3D Touch peek and pop gestures.

### Syntax

```

registerForPeekandPop(onPeekCallback, onPopCallback)
```

### Parameters

onPeekCallback

A callback function that is invoked when the user slightly presses (soft press) the widget.

### Callback Syntax

onPeekCallback(widget)

### Callback Input Parameters

_widget_

A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

### Callback Return Values

  A PreviewInfoTable. See the Remarks section for a description of this table.

### Callback Example

```

function onPeekCallback(widget) {
    var previewInfoTable = {
        "peekForm": frmSecond,
        "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
        "contentSize": [320, 480]
    };
    return previewInfoTable;
}
```

onPopCallback (Optional)

A callback function that is invoked when the user further presses (hard press) the preview that is displayed for the widget.

### Callback Syntax

onPopCallback(widget,peekForm)

### Callback Input Parameters

_widget_

A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

_peekForm_

A form reference that is displayed as preview/peek.

### Callback Return Values

  A form reference.

### Callback Remarks

Use this callback to set the content for pop. The form handle returned by this callback is used for pop content. In general, the form that is used for preview is used for pop content also. If the pop callback is not implemented, peek disappears and the app returns to its previous state.

### Callback Example

```

function onPopCallback(widget, peekForm) {
    // preview form used for pop also
    return peekForm;
}
```

### Remarks

    A PreviewInfoTable has the following format.

**Name:** peekForm

**Description:** The form reference that will be displayed as preview. If an invalid form reference is given, the preview will not be shown.

**Type:** form reference

**Name:** focusRect (Optional)

**Description:** An array representing a rectangle in widgets view coordinates. If provided, this rectangle will be focused while its surrounding area will be blurred, indicating a preview is available for the widget. If not provided, entire view area of the widget will be focused. If either the width or height is zero, the widget's view width/height is used. The values are supported in percentage(with regard to widget bounds), dp, or pixels. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If an array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:** Array \[x, y, width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “0dp”, “200dp”, “300dp”\], \[“10%”, “10%”, “75%”, “50%”\], \[“10px”, “10px”, “200px”, “480px”\]

**Name:** contentSize (Optional)

**Description:** An array representing the preferred content size of the preview. This allows the user to adjust the preferred width/height dimensions of the preview. If not provided, the preview is shown with default values. If either the width or height is zero, the default preview width/height is used. It is recommended that one of the width/height values be zero for proper adjustment of the other value. For example, if width = 0, the height is adjustable and vice versa. Providing positive values simultaneously for both width and height will result in distorted appearance of preview. The values are supported in dp, pixels, and percentage(with regard to screen bounds). The actual width/height of the preview may vary slightly due to resizing per aspect ratio. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:** Array \[width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “100dp”\], \[“100%”, “0%”\], \[“0px”, “240px”\]

This method enables you to set the badge value to the given widget at the upper, right corner of the widget.

### Syntax

```

setBadge(badgeText)
```

### Parameters

badgeText \[String\] - Mandatory

Specifies the Text value that appears within the badge. If the length of the badgeText is greater than 1, the badge is a rounded rectangle. For example, if you specify the text of the badge as 88, the number appears in a rounded rectangular badge. If the length of the badge text is 1, the badge is always a circle. The badge can occupy up to 70% of the width of the parent widget. For example, on a button with a width of 100 pixels, a badge with about 100 characters will occupy only 70 pixels of the button width. The badge text is truncated and shows about 30 characters followed by three dots.

skin \[String\] - Optional

The parameter specifies the background color for the badge. The default color is red.

### Return Values

None

### Exceptions

Error

### Remarks

The color for the badge can be defined using a skin. The default color for the badge is red with white lettering.

If you pass an empty string as a parameter, the badge applied to the widget is cleared.

A Badge can be applied only to the FlexContainer Widget. To apply badge to other widgets, place the corresponding widget inside the FlexContainer, then apply Badge to the FlexContainer Widget. Also make sure that the clipBounds property of the FlexContainer are set to false.

If the badge value is a single character (a character or a number), the badge shape is a circle.

![](Resources/Images/widgetbadge.png)

If the badge value contains multiple characters, the badge shape is a rectangle with rounded corners and borders.

The badge can occupy a maximum of 70% width of the parent widget (widget on which badge is applied). For example, on a button with a width of 100 pixels, a badge with about 100 characters will occupy only 70 pixels of the button width. The badge value is truncated and about 30 characters followed by three dots.

When a badge is set, the widgets are re-arranged to accommodate the badge.

For iOS platform, this method is applicable on Box, Label, and Image widgets only.

For Android platform, this method is applicable on Button and Image widgets only.

### Example

```

//This is a generic method that is applicable for various widgets.

### Callback Parameters

_widget_

A widget reference that is registered for peek and pop.

### Callback Return Values

PreviewInfoTable. See the Remarks section for a description of this table.

### Callback Example

```

function onPeekCallback(widget, contextInfo) {
    var previewInfoTable = {
        "peekForm": frmSecond,
        "focusRect": [0, 0, 200, 200],
        "contentSize": [320, 480]
    };
    return previewInfoTable;
}
```

### Return Values

None.

### Remarks

A PreviewInfoTable has the following format.

**Name:** peekForm

**Description:** The form reference that will be displayed as preview. If an invalid form reference is given, the preview will not be shown.

**Type:** form reference

**Name:** focusRect (Optional)

**Description:** An array representing a rectangle in widgets view coordinates. If provided, this rectangle will be focused while its surrounding area will be blurred, indicating a preview is available for the widget. If not provided, entire view area of the widget will be focused. If either the width or height is zero, the widget's view width/height is used. The values are supported in percentage(with regard to widget bounds), dp, or pixels. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If an array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:**Array \[x, y, width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “0dp”, “200dp”, “300dp”\], \[“10%”, “10%”, “75%”, “50%”\], \[“10px”, “10px”, “200px”, “480px”\]

**Name:**contentSize (Optional)

**Description:**An array representing the preferred content size of the preview. This allows the user to adjust the preferred width/height dimensions of the preview. If not provided, the preview is shown with default values. If either the width or height is zero, the default preview width/height is used. It is recommended that one of the width/height values be zero for proper adjustment of the other value. For example, if width = 0, the height is adjustable and vice versa. Providing positive values simultaneously for both width and height will result in distorted appearance of preview. The values are supported in dp, pixels, and percentage(with regard to screen bounds). The actual width/height of the preview may vary slightly due to resizing per aspect ratio. The values are strings. If a string value is given without any format specifier, it defaults to dp. If array of numbers is given, it is assumed they are dp values.

**Type:**Array \[width, height\]

Example: \[“0dp”, “100dp”\], \[“100%”, “0%”\], \[“0px”, “240px”\]

### Example of a PreviewInfoTable:

```

*   constants.ANIMATION\_CURVE\_EASEOUT: Specifies the animation effect to slowdown towards the end.
*   constants.ANIMATION\_CURVE\_EASEINOUT: Specifies the animation effect to start slow and slowdown towards the end.
*   constants.ANIMATION\_CURVE\_LINEAR: This is the default value. Specifies the animation effect to continue with the same speed from start to end.

animCallBacks - Optional

It is a JS dictionary containing the events invoked by the platform during the animation life cycle. Following are the available events:

*   **animStarted**: Invoked at the beginning of the animation without any parameters. Following is the Syntax of the event: function animStarted()
*   **animEnded**: Invoked at the end of the animation without any parameters. Following is the Syntax of the event: function animEnded()

### Return Values

None

### Exceptions

Error

### Remarks

This method is not applicable on Form, Popup, and Alert. It is also not applicable if the widget is placed in a [Segment](Segment.md). When the widget is placed in a Segment, the default _Visibility_ is set to _true_. If you want to change the value to _false_, you can do so by using [Segment](Segment_Methods.md#segmentedui-methods) methods.

Passing an invalid type other than the above events lead to run time exceptions/ crashes.

This method is not supported on the widgets FlexForm, FlexContainer, and FlexScrollContainer.

### Example

```

//This is a generic method that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to invoke the setVisibility Method for a button widget with animation.
//You need to make a corresponding call of the setVisibility method for other applicable widgets.

form1.myButton.setVisibility(
    false, {
        "animEffect": constants.ANIMATION_EFFECT_COLLAPSE,
        "animDuration": 1,
        "animDelay": 0,
        "animCurve": constants.ANIMATION_CURVE_LINEAR,
        "animCallBacks": {
            "animStarted": startCallBackFunc,
            "animEnded": endCallBackFunc
        }
    });
//Sample code to invoke setVisibility Method for button widget without animation.
form1.myButton.setVisibility(false);
