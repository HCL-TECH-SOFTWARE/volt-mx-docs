==================

The properties for Browser widget are as follows:

* * *


<details close markdown="block"><summary>accessibilityConfig Property</summary>

* * *

Enables you to control accessibility behavior and alternative text for the widget.

For more information on using accessibility features in your app, see the [Accessibility](../../../Iris/app_design_dev/Content/Accessibility_Overview.md) appendix in the Volt MX IrisUser Guide.

### Syntax

accessibilityConfig

### Type

Object

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   The accessibilityConfig property is enabled for all the widgets which are supported under the Flex Layout.

> **_Note:_** From Volt MX Iris V9 SP2 GA version, you can provide i18n keys as values to all the attributes used inside the `accessibilityConfig` property. Values provided in the i18n keys take precedence over values provided in `a11yLabel`, `a11yValue`, and `a11yHint` fields.

The accessibilityConfig property is a JavaScript object which can contain the following key-value pairs.

  
| Key | Type | Description | ARIA Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a11yIndex | Integer with no floating or decimal number. | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the order in which the widgets are focused on a screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-index`, `index`, or `taborder` properties. |
| a11yLabel | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies alternate text to identify the widget. Generally the label should be the text that is displayed on the screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-labelledby` property of ARIA in HTML. > **_Note:_** For the Image widget, this parameter maps to the **alt** attribute of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yValue | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | This parameter is similar to the a11yLabel parameter. If the a11yValue is defined, the value of a11yValue is appended to the value of a11yLabel. These values are separated by a space. |
| a11yHint | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-describedby` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yHidden | Boolean | This is an optional parameter. Specifies if the widget should be ignored by assistive technology. The default option is set to _false_. This option is supported on iOS 5.0 and above, Android 4.1 and above, and SPA | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-hidden` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yARIA | Object | This is an optional parameter. For each widget, the key and value provided in this object are added as the attribute and value of the HTML tags respectively. Any values provided for attributes such as `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` using this attribute, takes precedence over values given in `a11yLabel` and `a11yHint` fields. When a widget is provided with the following key value pair or attribute using the a11yARIA object, the tabIndex of the widget is automatically appended as zero.`{"role": "main"}``aria-label` | This parameter is only available on the Desktop Web platform. |

### Android limitations

*   If the results of the concatenation of a11y fields result in an empty string, then `accessibilityConfig` is ignored and the text that is on widget is read out.
*   The soft keypad does not gain accessibility focus during the right/left swipe gesture when the keypad appears.

### SPA/Desktop Web limitations

*   When `accessibilityConfig` property is configured for any widget, the `tabIndex` attribute is added automatically to the `accessibilityConfig` property.
*   The behavior of accessibility depends on the Web browser, Web browser version, Voice Over Assistant, and Voice Over Assistant version.
*   Currently SPA/Desktop web applications support only a few ARIA tags. To achieve more accessibility features, use the attribute a11yARIA. The corresponding tags will be added to the DOM as per these configurations.

### Example 1

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have an accessibilityConfig property.

```

//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the accessibilityConfig Property for button widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the accessibilityConfig property for other applicable widgets.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "Label",
    "a11yValue": "Value",
    "a11yHint": "Hint"    
};
```

### Example 2

This example uses the button widget to implement internationalization in `accessibilityConfig` property, but the principle remains the same for all widgets.

```

/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Native platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString("key1")     
};  
/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Desktop Web platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString(\"key3\")"
};
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>limitsNavigationsToAppBoundDomains Property</summary>

* * *

The iOS App-Bound Domains feature limits the tracking risk of in-app browsing, by restricting domain access by the app to those you specify. To use the feature, you add the WKAppBoundDomains key to `<projectDirectory>/resources/common/infoplist_configuration.json`and supply an array of domain name strings as the value. Here is a sample infoplist_configuration.json file entry to set app bound domains.
```
{ 
   "WKAppBoundDomains" : ["https://www.ExampleDomainl.com", "https://www.ExampleDomain2.com", "https://www.ExampleDomain3.com"]
}
``` 

By default, Browser widgets with Browser Type = WKWebView can use JavaScript injection, custom style sheets, cookie manipulation, and message handlers. However, once you add "WKAppBoundDomains" to infoplist_configuration.json, all WKWebView Browser instances in the app lose these capabilities. To restore access to these APIs, set limitsNavigationsToAppBoundDomains to true in the Browser widget configuration.

> **_Note:_**  You can also access the limitsNavigationsToAppBoundDomains property through code as part of the pspConfig Object. However, you can only enable (or add) this property when you create the Browser widget instance. You cannot change the value of this property after the Browser widget is initialized.

* * *

Specifies whether the widget should occupy the whole container or not when your Browser widget has a large HTML content to display.

### Syntax

screenLevelWidget

### Type

Boolean

### Read/Write

No

### Remarks

The default value for this property is false.

You must set the value to _true_ for your Browser widget occupy the complete Form and results in a good user experience.

If set to _false_, the widget does not occupy the whole container and a scroll bar appears on the Browser widget and the Form resulting in a bad user experience while scrolling.

You must not place more than one Browser widget as a screen level widget inside a Form. Also, if you choose to make a Browser widget a Screen Level Widget, you must place only the Browser widget in the Form and must not place any other widgets in the Form.

Do not set the screen level widget property to true for more than one widget in the form. If you have multiple widgets with this property set as true, there may be issues with how information is displayed along with some scrolling issues.

Few guidelines for using _screenLevelWidget_ property for Browser widget.

*   Placing any widgets below the Browser widget on a form is not advised as this leads to double scrolling issues. Use Browser widget as screen level widget and place the rest of the widgets as part of headers and footers.
*   In order to control the height of the Browser widget, place browser widget as screen level widget inside the ScrollBox and control the height of the ScrollBox.

On iPhone, Android, and Windows 10 platforms, if this property is set to _true_, the following are applicable:

iPhone

> When a browser widget is used on the form, make sure that all other widgets are part of header or footer of the form.

Android

Only the widgets placed above the Browser widget (which is a screen level widget) are visible. The widgets placed below the Browser widget are not visible when rendered.

Windows

The settings property helps you to configure the Browser Widget settings.

### Syntax

settings

### Type

Boolean

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

enableJavaScript Key

The property is configured as key-value pairs. The settings property accepts the enableJavaScript key. The enableJavaScript key allows to enable or disable the JavaScript in the Browser Widget. Following are the values accepted by the key:

*   `{“enableJavaScript”:true}`
*   `{“enableJavaScript”:false}`

The default value for the enableJavaScript key is true.

If the enableJavaScript key is set to _false_, the JavaScript is disabled in the Browser Widget.

If the enableJavaScript key is set to _true_, the JavaScript is enabled in the Browser Widget.

The values other than "true" and "false" are discarded.

> **_Note:_** Once the JavaScript is disabled and the Browser Widget is loaded, it is not possible to enable the JavaScript dynamically.

**allowFileAccess Key**

The settings property accepts the **allowFileAccess** key, which enables or disables file access in the Browser Widget.

```

{“allowFileAccess”:true}
{“allowFileAccess”:false}
```

The default value for allowFileAccess is true.

If the allowFileAccess is set to false, file access is disabled in the browser widget.

If the allowFileAccess is set to true, file access is enabled in the browser widget.

The values other than **true** and **false** are discarded.

The **allowFileAccess** key enables or disables file system access only. Assets and resources are still accessible using `file:///android_asset` and `file:///android_res`

If the Browser widget has to access any files through java script code ( for example, in button onclick accessing the sdcard files) , the **enableJavaScript** key and the **allowFileAccess** key should be configured to **true**. If the **enableJavaScript** is set to false and the **allowFileAccess** is set to **true**, the browser widget cannot access files.

Once the **allowFileAccess** key is disabled, and the Browser Widget is loaded, it is not possible to enable the **allowFileAccess** key dynamically.

### Example

```

//Sample code to enable settings property in Browser widget.  
frmBrowser.myBrowser.settings= {
    "enableJavaScript": false,
    "allowFileAccess": false
};

<details close markdown="block"><summary>SSLValidationBehavior Property</summary>

* * *

Prior to Iris V9 SP1 version, in the iOS platform, SSL validations occurred based on the values of _[allowbundledonly](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Certificate_Pinning.md#enable-certificate-pinning-in-ios)_ and _[VoltMXHTTPPublicKeyPinning](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Public_Key_Pinning.md#enable-public-key-pinning)_ in the `infoplist_configuration.json` file. From the Iris V9 version onwards, Browser widget supports only WKWebview engine. WKWebView engine enables pinning for all HTTPS URLs used inside the Browser widget. This means that all the hosts accessed in the Browser widget can be pinned using either public key pinning or SSL certificate pinning.  
  
From the Iris V9 SP 1 version , you can use the `SSLValidationBehavior` property to handle the SSL pinning and validation behavior of Browser widget in the iOS platform. This property can be used when public key pinning or SSL certificate pinning is enabled.

### Syntax

SSLValidationBehavior

### Type

Constant

You can provide any of the following constants as input to `SSLValidationBehavior` property.

*   `constants. SSL_VALIDATION_BEHAVIOR_NONE` : When this value is assigned to the _SSLValidationBehavior_ property, no Pinning validations will be performed on any URL.
*   `constants.SSL_VALIDATION_BEHAVIOR_DEFAULT`: When this value is assigned to the_SSLValidationBehvior_ property, only those URLs that are pinned are validated. All the URLs that are not pinned are rejected. This is the default value of this property.
*   `constants. SSL_VALIDATION_BEHAVIOR_CHECK_DECLARED_ALLOW_OTHERS` : When this value is assigned to the _SSLValidationBehavior_ property, the URLs that are pinned are validated. The URLs that are not pinned are not validated but these URLs are not rejected.

For more information on the behavior of these constants, refer the table provided under **Remarks**.

### Read/Write

Read Only

### Remarks

The following table lists the behavior of _SSLValidationBehavior_ property with the various values of _[allowbundledonly](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Certificate_Pinning.md#enable-certificate-pinning-in-ios)_ and _[VoltMXHTTPPublicKeyPinning](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/Public_Key_Pinning.md#enable-public-key-pinning)_ in _infoplist\_configuration.json_ file.

| allowbundledonly(Certificate Pinning) | VoltMXHTTPPublishKeyPinning (Public Key Pinning) | SSLValidationBehavior | Result |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| False | True | SSL\_VALIDATION\_BEHAVIOR\_NONE | All URLs are bypassed. |
| True | False | SSL\_VALIDATION\_BEHAVIOR\_NONE | All URLs are bypassed. |
| False | True | SSL\_VALIDATION\_BEHAVIOR\_DEFAULT | Only pinned URLs are validated. Rest of the URLs are rejected. |
| True | False | SSL\_VALIDATION\_BEHAVIOR\_DEFAULT | Only the URLs with the certificates pinned are validated. Rest of the URLs are rejected. |
| False | True | SSL\_VALIDATION\_BEHAVIOR\_CHECK\_DECLARED\_ALLOW\_OTHERS | The pinned URLs are validated. Rest are bypassed |

<details close markdown="block"><summary>top Property</summary>

* * *

This property determines the top edge of the widget and measured from the top bounds of the parent container.

The top property determines the position of the top edge of the widget’s bounding box. The value may be set using DP (Device Independent Pixels), Percentage, or Pixels. In freeform layout, the distance is measured from the top edge of the parent container. In flow-vertical layout, the distance is measured from the bottom edge of the previous sibling widget in the hierarchy. In flow-horizontal layout, the distance is measured from the left edge of the parent container.

### Syntax

top

### Type

String

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

If the layoutType is set as voltmx.flex.FLOW\_VERTICAL, the top property is measured from the bottom edge of the top sibling widget. The vertical space between two widgets is measured from bottom of the top sibling widget and top of the bottom sibling widget.

### Example

```

//Sample code to set the top property for widgets by using DP, Percentage and Pixels.
frmHome.widgetID.top = "50dp";

frmHome.widgetID.top = "10%";

frmHome.widgetID.top = "10px";

<details close markdown="block"><summary>zIndex Property</summary>

* * *

This property specifies the stack order of a widget. A widget with a higher zIndex is always in front of a widget with a lower zIndex.

The zIndex property is used to set the stack, or layer order of a widget. Widgets with higher values will appear “over”, or “on top of” widgets with lower values. Widgets layered over other widgets will override any interaction events tied to widgets beneath. Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets in the Volt MX Iris hierarchy, inside of a flexContainer or form. The zIndex property accepts only positive values.

### Syntax

zIndex

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The default value for this property is 1.

> **_Note:_** Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets inside the FlexContainer. If zIndex is same for group of overlapping widgets then widget order decides the order of overlapping. The last added widget is displayed on top.

From Volt MX Iris V9 SP2 FP7, developers can configure the Z Index value for a Responsive Web app as **Auto** or **Custom**. When the selected Z Index value is **Auto**, the default Z Index value of 1 is applied. When the selected Z Index value is **Custom**, developers can specify a desired numeric value.

Prior to the V9 SP2 FP7 release, the default value for the Z Index was **1**. When developers imported any third-party libraries with the Z index set as **Auto**, content overflow was disabled as the value of Auto is less than 1.

> **_Note:_** The Z Index value Auto is supported only when the Enable JS Library mode is configured as unchecked.

For existing components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Custom** with **1** as the value.

For new components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Auto** or **1** based on the project level settings.

> **_Note:_** If ModalContainer property is set to true in any of the FlexContainer widget, the Z Index value of that container and all of its parent containers should be set to **Custom**.

**voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO** : Constant to configure the Z Index value as **auto** programmatically.

```

//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto  
 var flx = new voltmx.ui.FlexContainer({ 
  "id": "flx"
  "zIndex": voltmx.flex.ZINDEX_AUTO
});

```
```

//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto
flx.zIndex = voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO;

```

### Example

```

//Sample code to set the zIndex property for widgets.  
frmHome.widgetID.zIndex = 300;
