=======================

RadioButtonGroup has the following events associated with it:

* * *


<details close markdown="block"><summary>doLayout Event</summary>

* * *

This event is invoked for every widget when the widget position and dimensions are computed.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

doLayout()
```

<b>Read/Write</b>

Read + Write

<b>Remarks</b>

This event is invoked for all the widgets placed inside flex containers. This event is invoked in the order in which the widgets are added to the widget hierarchy and expect the frame property of the widget is calculated and available for use within this event.

This event is used to set the layout properties of child widgets in the relation to self and peer widgets whose layout is not yet performed.

The number of times this event invoked may vary per platform. It is not recommended to write business logic assuming that this function is invoked only once when there is a change in positional or dimensional properties. This event will not trigger when transformations are applied though widget is moved or scaled or rotated from its original location.

<b>Example</b>

```
//Sample code to set doLayout event callback to a button widget.
/*This code changes the top property of button2 and makes it appear below button1.*/
myForm.button1.doLayout=doLayoutButton1;


function doLayoutButton1(){
      
    myForm.button2.top = myForm.button1.frame.height;
}
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>onScrollWidgetPosition Event</summary>

* * *

This event callback is invoked by the platform when the widget location position gets changed on scrolling. The onScrollWidgetPosition event returns the positional coordinates of the widget's location with respect to the screen (screenX and screenY) and the parent container (frameX and frameY). This event is invoked asynchronously, and is not available for FlexForm widget.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

onScrollWidgetPosition()
```

<b>Read/Write</b>

Read + Write

<b>Example</b>

```
var LabelWdg = new voltmx.ui.Label(basicConf, layoutConf, pspConf);
form.add(LabelWdg);
LabelWdg.onScrollWidgetPosition = onScrollWidgetPositionCallBack;

function onScrollWidgetPositionCallBack(wdg, screenX, screenY, frameX, frameY) { //wdg : Widget that is registered for onScrollWidgetPosition.
    /*screenX : Position of widget with respect to 
the screen's X - coordinates (after downsizing the navigation bar and status bar).*/
    /*screenY : Position of widget with respect to the screen's Y - 
coordinates (after downsizing the navigation bar and status bar).*/
    //frameX : Position of widget with respect to parent container's X- coordinates.
    //frameY : Position of widget with respect to parent container's Y- coordinates.
}
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>onSelection Event</summary>

* * *

An event callback that is invoked by the platform when an item is selected or deselected.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

onSelection()
```

<b>Read/Write</b>

Read + Write

<b>Remarks</b>

For Server side Mobile Web (Basic devices), this event is fired only when you make a selection and then write an onClick event for a button.

<b>Example</b>

```
//Sample code to set the onSelection event callback to a RadioButtonGroup widget.

frmRButton.myRButton.onSelection=onSelectionCallBack;
function onSelectionCallBack(radio){
  //Write your logic here.
 }

```

<b>Platform Availability</b>

Available on all platforms.

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>onTouchEnd Event</summary>

* * *

An event callback is invoked by the platform when the user touch is released from the touch surface.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

onTouchEnd ()
```

<b>Optional Parameters</b>

source

Handle to the widget reference on which the user touch has ended.

x

Specifies the x-coordinate with in the widget with respect to widget's co-ordinate system. It is a number indicating device independent pixel.

y

Specifies the y- coordinate with in the widget with respect to widget's co-ordinate system. It is a number indicating device independent pixel.

contextInfo

On devices that support 3D Touch, specifies a key-value pair where the value specifies the force of the touch. The value 1.0 represents the force of an average touch, as determined by the system.

> **_Note:_** 3D Touch is available only on iOS 9.0 and later.

<b>Read/Write</b>

Read + Write

<b>Remarks</b>

This event is invoked asynchronously.

<b>Example</b>

```
function onTouchEndCallback(source, x, y, contextInfo) {
    if (contextInfo) {
        var force = contextInfo[“force”];
        voltmx.print(“value of force is” + force)
    }
}
Form1.widget1.onTouchEnd = onTouchEndCallback;
```

<b>Platform Availability</b>

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>onTouchMove Event</summary>

* * *

An event callback is invoked by the platform when the touch moves on the touch surface continuously until movement ends.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

onTouchMove ()
```

<b>Optional Parameters</b>

source

Handle to the widget reference on which touch moves.

x

Specifies the x-coordinate with in the widget with respect to widget's co-ordinate system. It is a number indicating device independent pixel.

y

Specifies the y- coordinate with in the widget with respect to widget's co-ordinate system. It is a number indicating device independent pixel.

contextInfo

On devices that support 3D Touch, specifies a key-value pair where the value specifies the force of the touch. The value 1.0 represents the force of an average touch, as determined by the system.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

onTouchStart ()

<details close markdown="block"><summary>postOnclickJS Event</summary>

* * *

This event allows the developer to execute custom javascript function after the _onSelection_ callback of the RadioButton is invoked.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

postOnclickJS()
```

<b>Read/Write</b>

Read + Write

<b>Remarks</b>

This is applicable only for Mobile Web channel. The function must exist in a javascript file under project>module>js folder.

<b>Example</b>

```
//Sample code to set the postOnclickJS event callback to a RadioButtonGroup widget.

frmRButton.myRButton.postOnclickJS=postOnclickJSCallBck;
function postOnclickJSCallBck(radio){
  //Write your logic here.
 }

```

<b>Platform Availability</b>

*   Available in the IDE
*   Available on Server side Mobile Web (Advanced) platform only

* * *

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>preOnclickJS Event</summary>

* * *

This event allows the developer to execute custom javascript function before the _onSelection_ callback of the RadioButton is invoked.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

preOnclickJS()
```

<b>Read/Write</b>

Read + Write

<b>Remarks</b>

This is applicable only for Mobile Web channel. The function must exist in a javascript file under project>module>js folder.

This event should return true, to continue with execution of onSelection and postOnclickJS events.

In for the events preOnclickJS and postOnclickJS you will not be able to access application model or APIs, as these functions are executed in browser whereas the remaining JS modules are executed in server. For these events you can access browser objects ( window, document etc..) to change UI or perform some validation before server event. If the event preOnclickJS returns true, only then the request is sent to server for subsequent action. You have to specify the modules to be loaded in browser using import JS tab, only then these files get included in.html script tag otherwise you will not be able to access the objects defined in those modules.

<b>Example</b>

```
//Sample code to set the preOnclickJS event callback to a RadioButtonGroup widget.

frmRButton.myRButton.preOnclickJS=preOnclickJSCallBck;
function preOnclickJSCallBck(radio){
  //Write your logic here.
 }

```
