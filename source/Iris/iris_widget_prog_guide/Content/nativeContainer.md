NativeContainer Widget
======================

The NativeContainer Widget helps you develop, use, and add native UI widgets using the NativeFunction API. The widgets that are defined by the Android and iOS platforms are known as native UI widgets. Using the NativeFunction APIs, you can make use of the native widgets directly in your applications.

For example, you can add the Button Widget defined by the Android platform into your application. The NativeContainer widget allows you to add only native controls and widgets to it.

**Adding Native widgets:** You can add cross platform widgets and platform specific widgets that are specific to iOS or Android, into the NativeContainer and customize it. FlexContainer widget does not support native widgets. To learn more about adding the widget to a form, refer [NativeContainer widget Basics](#nativecontainer-widget-basics).

The NativeContainer widget capabilities can be broadly categorized into the following:

*   [Layout](#layout)
*   [UI Appearance](#ui-appearance)
*   [Data Management](#data-management)
*   [3D Touch](#3d-touch)
*   [User Input Handling](#user-input-handling)
*   [Enabling RTL](#enabling-rtl)
*   [Miscellaneous](#miscellaneous)
*   [Configurations Common To All Widgets](#configurations-common-to-all-widgets)

NativeContainer Widget Basics
-----------------------------

> **_Note:_** You cannot add the widgets from the Default Library of Volt MX Iristo the NativeContainer Widget.

In the Widgets palette, the NativeContainer Widget appears only after a NativeFunction is imported to the Volt MX Iris and when the respective native canvas is selected. For example, if you have imported the NativeFunction corresponding to the Android native, the NativeContainer Widget appears only when Android canvas is selected. For more information on importing the NativeFunction, see [Importing NativeFunction](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/importing_ssm.md).

You can place the NativeContainer Widget in the FlexForm, FlexContainer, FlexScrollContainer, and Master Flex/FlexScroll containers. You cannot add the NativeContainer widget to other container widgets like Tab and TabPane, and also in a template. Even a Master Widget containing a NativeContainer Widget cannot be placed in a template.

The NativeContainer Widget adheres to the flex container semantics as the NativeContainer can be placed in all the flex container widgets. The NativeContainer Widget supports all positional and dimensional properties. For more information on flex container semantics, see [Flex Container Rules](FlexContainerRules.md).

The actual layout view displayed on the screen is platform-specific. The platform-specific layouts differ from platform to platform and are displayed only for the respective platforms. For Android, RelativeLayout is used whereas for iOS, Auto Layout is used. The following links provide more information on the platform-specific layouts.

*   RelativeLayout: [http://developer.Android.com/reference/Android/widget/RelativeLayout.html](http://developer.android.com/reference/android/widget/RelativeLayout.html)
*   Auto Layout: [https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/index.html#//apple\_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853-CH7-SW1](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/UserExperience/Conceptual/AutolayoutPG/index.md#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40010853-CH7-SW1)

All the APIs, constants, and properties of these layouts can be used on the Layout returned using the NativeContainer’s Events and Methods.
