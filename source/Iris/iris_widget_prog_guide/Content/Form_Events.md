-----------

This widget has been deprecated. Older applications that use it will still function, but new applications should use the [FlexForm](FlexForm.md) widget.

Form widget has the following events associated:

> **_Note:_** In Server side Mobile Web platform, only the last event _form.show_ or an alert will be displayed. For example, If there are 3 alert statements and an event form.show in the end, then form is displayed. Alert will not be displayed. Similarly you call a form.show and in subsequent statements or in form pre/post events you call alert then that alert will be displayed but not the form.

### addWidgets Event

An event callback invoked by the platform when the form is accessed for first time after its construction. This function gets executed only once on in lifetime of the form. If a destroyed form is accessed, the form is re-initialized and this callback is once again invoked. Forms can be destroyed using destroy method.

Syntax

addWidgets()

var frmBasic = {id:"frm", type:constants.FORM_TYPE_NATIVE , title:"Title", addWidgets:addWidgetsCalBck};

var frmLayout ={displayOrientation:constants.FORM_DISPLAY_ORIENTATION_BOTH, paddingInPixel:false, padding:[5,5,5,5]};
