=========================

The properties for CordovaBrowserwidget are as follows.

<details close markdown="block"><summary>accessibilityConfig Property</summary>

* * *

Enables you to control accessibility behavior and alternative text for the widget.

For more information on using accessibility features in your app, see the [Accessibility](../../../Iris/app_design_dev/Content/Accessibility_Overview.md) appendix in the Volt MX IrisUser Guide.

### Syntax

```

accessibilityConfig
```

### Type

Object

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   The accessibilityConfig property is enabled for all the widgets which are supported under the Flex Layout.

> **_Note:_** From Volt MX Iris V9 SP2 GA version, you can provide i18n keys as values to all the attributes used inside the `accessibilityConfig` property. Values provided in the i18n keys take precedence over values provided in `a11yLabel`, `a11yValue`, and `a11yHint` fields.

### The accessibilityConfig property is a JavaScript object which can contain the following key-value pairs.

  
| Key | Type | Description | ARIA Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a11yIndex | Integer with no floating or decimal number. | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the order in which the widgets are focused on a screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-index`, `index`, or `taborder` properties. |
| a11yLabel | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies alternate text to identify the widget. Generally the label should be the text that is displayed on the screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-labelledby` property of ARIA in HTML. > **_Note:_** For the Image widget, this parameter maps to the **alt** attribute of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yValue | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | This parameter is similar to the a11yLabel parameter. If the a11yValue is defined, the value of a11yValue is appended to the value of a11yLabel. These values are separated by a space. |
| a11yHint | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-describedby` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yHidden | Boolean | This is an optional parameter. Specifies if the widget should be ignored by assistive technology. The default option is set to _false_. This option is supported on iOS 5.0 and above, Android 4.1 and above, and SPA | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-hidden` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yARIA | Object | This is an optional parameter. For each widget, the key and value provided in this object are added as the attribute and value of the HTML tags respectively. Any values provided for attributes such as `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` using this attribute, takes precedence over values given in `a11yLabel` and `a11yHint` fields. When a widget is provided with the following key value pair or attribute using the a11yARIA object, the tabIndex of the widget is automatically appended as zero.`{"role": "main"}``aria-label` | This parameter is only available on the Desktop Web platform. |

### Android limitations

*   If the results of the concatenation of a11y fields result in an empty string, then `accessibilityConfig` is ignored and the text that is on widget is read out.
*   The soft keypad does not gain accessibility focus during the right/left swipe gesture when the keypad appears.

SPA/Desktop Web limitations

*   When `accessibilityConfig` property is configured for any widget, the `tabIndex` attribute is added automatically to the `accessibilityConfig` property.
*   The behavior of accessibility depends on the Web browser, Web browser version, Voice Over Assistant, and Voice Over Assistant version.
*   Currently SPA/Desktop web applications support only a few ARIA tags. To achieve more accessibility features, use the attribute a11yARIA. The corresponding tags will be added to the DOM as per these configurations.

### Example 1

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have an accessibilityConfig property.

```

//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the accessibilityConfig Property for button widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the accessibilityConfig property for other applicable widgets.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "Label",
    "a11yValue": "Value",
    "a11yHint": "Hint"    
};
```

### Example 2

This example uses the button widget to implement internationalization in `accessibilityConfig` property, but the principle remains the same for all widgets.

```

/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Native platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString("key1")     
};  
/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Desktop Web platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString(\"key3\")"
};
```

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>anchorPoint Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the anchor point of the widget bounds rectangle using the widget's coordinate space.

### Syntax

```

anchorPoint
```

### Type

JSObject

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The value for this property is a JavaScript dictionary object with the keys "x" and "y". The values for the "x" and "y" keys are floating-point numbers ranging from 0 to 1. All geometric manipulations to the widget occur about the specified point. For example, applying a rotation transform to a widget with the default anchor point causes the widget to rotate around its center.

The default value for this property is center ( {"x":0.5, "y":0.5} ), that represents the center of the widgets bounds rectangle. The behavior is undefined if the values are outside the range zero (0) to one (1).

### Example

```

Form1.widget1.anchorPoint = {
    "x": 0.5,
    "y": 0.5
};
```

### Platform Availability

*   iOS, Android, Windows, and SPA

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>baseURL Property</summary>

* * *

This property is used to configure the base URL that is displayed when a CordovaBrowser widget is rendered.

### Syntax

```

baseURL
```

### Type

String

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The default value for this property is false.

If the baseURL is not configured then the default URL is displayed. The default URL is the root folder of your application. Leaving this property blank or specifying it as nil introduces a security vulnerability on current versions of iOS that can enable an attacker to trick mobile device users into clicking on a malicious URL that accesses the device's entire file system. To prevent attacks using this property, developers should set baseURL to about:blank or some other known value. Under no circumstances should this property be left blank or specified as nil.

This property disables the cross site scripting to avoid security vulnerability.

### Example

```

// The variable "browser" is an instance of a CordovaBrowser widget.			
frm.browser.baseURL = "http://www.abcd.com"; 
```

*   constants.BROWSER\_MIXED\_CONTENT\_COMPATIBILITY\_MODE: When the `mixedContentMode` property is set to this value, the CordovaBrowser widget behaves similar to a web browser and attempts to load the content without certifications. This content may be loaded or blocked depending on the release and is not explicitly defined. You can use this mode of loading content when your application is not in control of the content, but the content is being operated from a secure environment.

<details close markdown="block"><summary>screenLevelWidget Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies whether the widget should occupy the whole container or not when your Browser widget has a large HTML content to display.

### Syntax

```

screenLevelWidget
```

### Type

Boolean

### Read/Write

No

### Remarks

The default value for this property is false.

You must set the value to _true_ for your Browser widget occupy the complete Form and results in a good user experience.

If set to _false_, the widget does not occupy the whole container and a scroll bar appears on the Browser widget and the Form resulting in a bad user experience while scrolling.

You must not place more than one Browser widget as a screen level widget inside a Form. Also, if you choose to make a Browser widget a Screen Level Widget, you must place only the Browser widget in the Form and must not place any other widgets in the Form.

Do not set the screen level widget property to true for more than one widget in the form. If you have multiple widgets with this property set as true, there may be issues with how information is displayed along with some scrolling issues.

Few guidelines for using _screenLevelWidget_ property for Browser widget.

*   Placing any widgets below the Browser widget on a form is not advised as this leads to double scrolling issues. Use Browser widget as screen level widget and place the rest of the widgets as part of headers and footers.
*   In order to control the height of the Browser widget, place browser widget as screen level widget inside the ScrollBox and control the height of the ScrollBox.

On iPhone, Android, and Windows platforms, if this property is set to _true_, the following are applicable:

### iPhone

> When a browser widget is used on the form, make sure that all other widgets are part of header or footer of the form.

### Android

Only the widgets placed above the Browser widget (which is a screen level widget) are visible. The widgets placed below the Browser widget are not visible when rendered.

### Windows

> The widgets placed above and below the Browser widget (which is a screen level widget) are not visible when rendered.

> **_Note:_** If you configure Application level Header and Footer, they will be visible even if the browser is a screen level widget.

<details close markdown="block"><summary>zIndex Property</summary>

* * *

This property specifies the stack order of a widget. A widget with a higher zIndex is always in front of a widget with a lower zIndex.

The zIndex property is used to set the stack, or layer order of a widget. Widgets with higher values will appear “over”, or “on top of” widgets with lower values. Widgets layered over other widgets will override any interaction events tied to widgets beneath. Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets in the Volt MX Iris hierarchy, inside of a flexContainer or form. The zIndex property accepts only positive values.

### Syntax

```

zIndex
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The default value for this property is 1.

> **_Note:_** Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets inside the FlexContainer. If zIndex is same for group of overlapping widgets then widget order decides the order of overlapping. The last added widget is displayed on top.

From Volt MX Iris V9 SP2 FP7, developers can configure the Z Index value for a Responsive Web app as **Auto** or **Custom**. When the selected Z Index value is **Auto**, the default Z Index value of 1 is applied. When the selected Z Index value is **Custom**, developers can specify a desired numeric value.

Prior to the V9 SP2 FP7 release, the default value for the Z Index was **1**. When developers imported any third-party libraries with the Z index set as **Auto**, content overflow was disabled as the value of Auto is less than 1.

> **_Note:_** The Z Index value Auto is supported only when the Enable JS Library mode is configured as unchecked.

For existing components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Custom** with **1** as the value.

For new components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Auto** or **1** based on the project level settings.

> **_Note:_** If ModalContainer property is set to true in any of the FlexContainer widget, the Z Index value of that container and all of its parent containers should be set to **Custom**.

**voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO** : Constant to configure the Z Index value as **auto** programmatically.

```

//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto  
 var flx = new voltmx.ui.FlexContainer({ 
  "id": "flx"
  "zIndex": voltmx.flex.ZINDEX_AUTO
});

```
