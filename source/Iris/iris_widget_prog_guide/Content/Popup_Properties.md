**Default:** POPUP\_ADJUST\_RESIZE

Following are the available options:

*   POPUP\_ADJUST\_RESIZE: Specifies the popup is resized and when you click or start typing within the widget which requires an input, the popup scrolls up and the widget which requires an input is not overlapped by the keypad or footer.
*   POPUP\_ADJUST\_PAN: Specifies the widget which requires an input is placed at the bottom of the popup is overlapped by the keypad. The main Popup is not resized to make room for the soft keyboard. Rather, the contents of the Popup are automatically panned so that the current focus is never obscured by the keyboard and users can always see what they are typing. This is generally less desirable than resizing, because the user may need to close the soft keyboard to get at and interact with obscured parts of the Popup.

### Example

```

//Defining properties for a Popup with windowSoftInputMode:constants.POPUP_ADJUST_RESIZE
var popBasic ={id:"popUp", title:"PopUP", skin:"popSkin", isModal:true};

var popLayout ={containerWeight:100, padding:[5,5,5,5]};

var popPSP ={**windowSoftInputMode:constants.POPUP_ADJUST_RESIZE**};
		  
//Creating the Popup.
var popUp=new voltmx.ui.Popup(popBasic, popLayout, popPSP);
```
