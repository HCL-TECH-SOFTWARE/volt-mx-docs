FlexForm Properties
===================

The properties for FlexForm widget are as follows.

* * *

<details close markdown="block"><summary>accessibilityConfig Property</summary>

* * *

Enables you to control accessibility behavior and alternative text for the widget.

For more information on using accessibility features in your app, see the [Accessibility](../../../Iris/app_design_dev/Content/Accessibility_Overview.md) appendix in the Volt MX IrisUser Guide.

### Syntax

```

accessibilityConfig
```

### Type

Object

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   The accessibilityConfig property is enabled for all the widgets which are supported under the Flex Layout.

> **_Note:_** From Volt MX Iris V9 SP2 GA version, you can provide i18n keys as values to all the attributes used inside the `accessibilityConfig` property. Values provided in the i18n keys take precedence over values provided in `a11yLabel`, `a11yValue`, and `a11yHint` fields.

### The accessibilityConfig property is a JavaScript object which can contain the following key-value pairs.

  
| Key | Type | Description | ARIA Equivalent |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| a11yIndex | Integer with no floating or decimal number. | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the order in which the widgets are focused on a screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-index`, `index`, or `taborder` properties. |
| a11yLabel | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies alternate text to identify the widget. Generally the label should be the text that is displayed on the screen. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-labelledby` property of ARIA in HTML. > **_Note:_** For the Image widget, this parameter maps to the **alt** attribute of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yValue | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | This parameter is similar to the a11yLabel parameter. If the a11yValue is defined, the value of a11yValue is appended to the value of a11yLabel. These values are separated by a space. |
| a11yHint | String | This is an optional parameter. Specifies the descriptive text that explains the action associated with the widget. On the Android platform, the text specified for a11yValue is prefixed to the a11yHint. | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-describedby` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yHidden | Boolean | This is an optional parameter. Specifies if the widget should be ignored by assistive technology. The default option is set to _false_. This option is supported on iOS 5.0 and above, Android 4.1 and above, and SPA | For all widgets, this parameter maps to the `aria-hidden` property of ARIA in HTML. |
| a11yARIA | Object | This is an optional parameter. For each widget, the key and value provided in this object are added as the attribute and value of the HTML tags respectively. Any values provided for attributes such as `aria-labelledby` and `aria-describedby` using this attribute, takes precedence over values given in `a11yLabel` and `a11yHint` fields. When a widget is provided with the following key value pair or attribute using the a11yARIA object, the tabIndex of the widget is automatically appended as zero.`{"role": "main"}``aria-label` | This parameter is only available on the Desktop Web platform. |

### Android limitations

*   If the results of the concatenation of a11y fields result in an empty string, then `accessibilityConfig` is ignored and the text that is on widget is read out.
*   The soft keypad does not gain accessibility focus during the right/left swipe gesture when the keypad appears.

### SPA/Desktop Web limitations

*   When `accessibilityConfig` property is configured for any widget, the `tabIndex` attribute is added automatically to the `accessibilityConfig` property.
*   The behavior of accessibility depends on the Web browser, Web browser version, Voice Over Assistant, and Voice Over Assistant version.
*   Currently SPA/Desktop web applications support only a few ARIA tags. To achieve more accessibility features, use the attribute a11yARIA. The corresponding tags will be added to the DOM as per these configurations.

### Example 1

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have an accessibilityConfig property.

```

//This is a generic property that is applicable for various widgets.
//Here, we have shown how to use the accessibilityConfig Property for button widget.
/*You need to make a corresponding use of the accessibilityConfig property for other applicable widgets.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "Label",
    "a11yValue": "Value",
    "a11yHint": "Hint"    
};
```

### Example 2

This example uses the button widget to implement internationalization in `accessibilityConfig` property, but the principle remains the same for all widgets.

```

/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Native platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString("key1")     
};  
/*Sample code to implement internationalization in accessibilityConfig property in Desktop Web platform.*/

Form1.myButton.accessibilityConfig = {
    "a11yLabel": "voltmx.i18n.getLocalizedString(\"key3\")"
};
```

* * *

Specifies whether the scroll bounce is enabled or disabled in the horizontal direction.

### Syntax

```

allowHorizontalBounce
```

### Type

Boolean

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The default value for this property is true. That is the scroll bounce is enabled in horizontal direction.

> **_Note:_** The **bounces** property takes precedence over this property.

### Example

```

//Sample code to enable horizontal bounce in a FlexForm.

myForm.allowHorizontalBounce=true;    
```

### Platform Availability

Available in the IDE.

This property is available on iOS platform only.

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>allowVerticalBounce Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies whether the scroll bounce is enabled or disabled in the vertical direction.

### Syntax

```

allowVerticalBounce
```

### Type

Boolean

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The default value for this property is true. That is the scroll bounce is enabled in vertical direction.

> **_Note:_** The **bounces** property takes precedence over this property.

### Example

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>anchorPoint Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the anchor point of the widget bounds rectangle using the widget's coordinate space.

### Syntax

```

anchorPoint
```

### Type

JSObject

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The value for this property is a JavaScript dictionary object with the keys "x" and "y". The values for the "x" and "y" keys are floating-point numbers ranging from 0 to 1. All geometric manipulations to the widget occur about the specified point. For example, applying a rotation transform to a widget with the default anchor point causes the widget to rotate around its center.

The default value for this property is center ( {"x":0.5, "y":0.5} ), that represents the center of the widgets bounds rectangle. The behavior is undefined if the values are outside the range zero (0) to one (1).

### Example

```

Form1.widget1.anchorPoint = {
    "x": 0.5,
    "y": 0.5
};
```

### Platform Availability

*   iOS, Android, Windows, and SPA

* * *

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>backgroundColor Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the background color of the widget.

### Syntax

```

backgroundColor
```

### Type

Color constant or Hexadecimal number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   The initial value of backgroundColor has to be specified explicitly. If not, Iris will not deduce the values from the existing skin
    and this will lead to undefined behavior.
*   Colors can be specified using a 6 digit or an 8-digit hex value with alpha position. For example, ffff65 or ffffff00.
*   When the 4-byte color format (RGBA) string is used, an alpha (A) value of 65 specifies that the color is transparent. If the value
    is 00, the color is opaque. The Alpha value is in percentage and must be given in the hexadecimal value for the color (100% in hexadecimal value is 65).  
    For example, red complete opaque is FF000000. Red complete transparent is FF000065. The values 0x and # are not allowed in the string.
*   A color constant is a String that is defined at the theme level. Ensure that you append the **$** symbol at the beginning of the
    color constant.
*   This property does not have a default value.
*   This property has more priority than (and overrides) the background property of the configured skin. Even if there is no skin
    configured for the widget, this property updates the skin.
*   The backgroundColor, backgroundColorTwoStepGradient, backgroundColoMultiStepGradient, and backgroundImage properties are mutually
    exclusive. The property that was set most recently is given higher priority over other properties.

### Example

This example uses the button widget, but the principle remains the same for all widgets that have the backgroundColor property.

```

Form1.btn1.backgroundColor = "ea5075";

```

### Platform Availability

*   Android
*   iOS

<details close markdown="block"><summary>inputAccessoryViewType Property</summary>

* * *

When building iPhone applications that support or provide text input, it's often necessary to create some extra buttons (or other controls) beyond the ones provided by the default keyboard interface. Volt MX Iris by default, adds the Previous, Next and Done buttons to the applicable input controls. These buttons allow specific operations needed by your application, such as moving to the next or previous text field, make the keyboard disappear. The area above the keyboard is known as Input Accessory View.

### Syntax

```

inputAccessoryViewType
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

No

### Remarks

The default value for this property is FORM\_INPUTACCESSORYVIEW\_DEFAULT.

This property, allows you to specify the type of accessory view that will be shown for all the input controls on this form.

![](Resources/Images/onlynextprevtoolbar.png)

> **_Note:_** The inputAccessoryViewType defined in the form level takes precedence over the inputAccessoryViewType defined in application level settings.

> **_Note:_** For iOS, by default header with "Prev" and "Next" buttons will be prepended to the keypad. This header can be turned off at two levels Application Level and Form Level.

**To turn on/off the header at Application Level, follow these steps:**

1.  Go to **Applications view**.
2.  Right-click on the application and select **Properties**.
3.  Navigate to **Native App** tab, under **Platform Settings** change the value to **none**.

**To turn on/off the header at Form Level, follow these steps:**

1.  Select the form and go to **Widget Properties** .
2.  Under iPhone properties, select **inputAccessoryViewType** and set the value to **FORM\_INPUTACCESSORYVIEW\_NONE**.

You can use any of the following constants. You must specify each constant with the ‘constants.xx’ prefix.

*   FORM\_INPUTACCESSORYVIEW\_NONE: Use this option if you do not want to specify the toolbar.  
    This option should be used carefully, as setting this option for widgets like calendar leaves the user with no option to select and drop-down a wheel calendar.
*   FORM\_INPUTACCESSORYVIEW\_DEFAULT: Specifies that the toolbar that is defined in the Application level settings. To set the Application level settings, right-click on the project and navigate to `Properties> Native App>iPhone/iPad.`  
    
*   FORM\_INPUTACCESSORYVIEW\_NEXTPREV: Specifies the navigation options as Next, Previous, and Done for a form. The below image illustrates the nextprevtoolbar set for a Textbox. The highlighted toolbar is achieved by setting the Keyboard Type as _Default_ for a Textbox and Input Accessory View Type as _nextprevtoolbar_ to the Form.

![](Resources/Images/nextprevtoolbar.png)

*   FORM\_INPUTACCESSORYVIEW\_CANCEL: Specifies that the input accessory view has a cancel button. This option does not trigger any events.

### Example

```

//Sample code to set the inputAccessoryViewType property by using FlexForm.  
  
myForm.inputAccessoryViewType=constants.FORM_INPUTACCESSORYVIEW_DEFAULT;

Specifies the configuration to be used when the user arrives on this form. It accepts hash values.

### Syntax

```

inTransitionConfig
```

### Type

JSObject

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

Following are the properties available for iPhone and iPad:

> **_Note:_** On iOS platform, In Transition is the transition that gets applied as the form enters the navigation stack. Every form.show either results in push into navigation stack ( enter the navigation stack) or if the form is already in stack, results popping up all the forms including the current form from the navigation stack. This is done to be in sync with the iOS native semantics of form (UIView Controller) transitions. For inTransition and outTransition, the push or pop operations are applied as below: A Form's inTransition will be played when a form is pushed inside the stack for rendering. The outTransition of the top most form in the stack will be played when the forms are popped out. For example, Form1 and Form2 are already in the stack, When you call form3.show() -> form3 will be pushed into the stack and its inTransition will be applied. The stack state after the push will be \[Form1, Form2, Form3\]. When you call form1.show() -> form2 and form3 will be popped out and form3's outTransition will be applied. The stack state after the pop will be \[Form1\].

> **_Note:_** Transition Animations are not supported when a flow of transitions from a form with AppMenu to a form without AppMenu.

**transitionDirection:** Specifies the direction from which the From is displayed. The available options are:

1.  none - Use this option if you do not want to specify a transition direction.
2.  fromRight - Specifies that the Form must appear from the right.
3.  fromLeft - Specifies that the Form must appear from the left.
4.  fromBottom - Specifies that the Form must appear from the bottom.
5.  fromTop - Specifies that the Form must appear from the top.

**transitionEffect:** Specifies the effect from which the form is displayed. The available options are:

1.  none - Use this option if you do not want to specify a transition direction.
2.  transitionFade - Specifies that the form must fade when it is transitioned to a hidden or an invisible state.
3.  transitionMoveIn - Specifies that the form must slide over the existing content in the direction as specified in the _transitionDirection_.
4.  transitionPush - Specifies that the form must push the existing content in the direction as specified in the _transitionDirection_ preserve">var var take its place.
5.  transitionFlip - Specifies that the form must be rotated along the Y-axis as the content is being displayed. It supports transition directions **fromRight** and **fromLeft** only.
6.  transitionReveal - Specifies that the form must be revealed gradually in the direction as specified in the _transitionDirection_.
7.  transitionCurl - Specifies that the form must be curled or folded (look and feel is similar to turning of a page in a book) as the content is being displayed. It supports transition directions **fromTop** and **fromBottom** only.
8.  transitionTwoSplitHorizontalIn - Specifies the form which is split horizontally into two parts rejoins when the transition takes place.
9.  transitionTwoSplitVerticalIn - Specifies the form which is split vertically into two parts rejoins when the transition takes place.
10.  transitionFourSplitIn - Specifies the form which is split in four parts rejoins when the transition takes place.
11.  transitionFourSplitRotateIn - Specifies the form which is split in four parts rejoins by rotating the parts when the transition takes place.
12.  transitionTwoSplitHorizontalOut - Specifies the form which is split horizontally into two parts and move away when the transition takes place.
13.  transitionTwoSplitVerticalOut - Specifies the form which is split vertically into two parts and move away when the transition takes place.
14.  transitionFourSplitRotateOut - Specifies the form which is split in four parts move away by rotating the parts when the transition takes place.
15.  transitionSwitchLeft - Specifies that the form must go out of the view in 3D circular space along the Y-axis towards left as the content is being displayed.
16.  transitionSwitchRight - Specifies that the form must go out of the view in 3D circular space along the Y-axis towards right as the content is being displayed.
17.  transitionCloth - Specifies the present form must go out of screen animating as if a cloth is removed.
18.  transitionFlipRight - Specifies that the form must be rotated along the Y-axis as the content is being displayed giving an illusion of a page is turned towards right in a book.
19.  transitionFlipLeft - Specifies that the form must be rotated along the Y-axis as the content is being displayed giving an illusion of a page is turned towards left in a book.
20.  transitionDoor - Specifies that the form must be revealed giving an illusion of a opening a door.
21.  transitionRotateExchange - Specifies that the form must be rotated along the X-axis as the content is being displayed.
22.  version - If you specify version = 1.0, the outTransitionCofig behavior of the outgoing form and the inTransitionConfig behavior of the incoming form are played out simultaneously. When version = 1.0, Iris checks for this key in the inTransitionConfig property of the form that needs this functionality. The following transitions can be played by using the version key:
    
    *   transitionMoveIn
        
    *   transitionMoveOut
        
    *   transitionFlip
        
    *   transitionReveal
        
    *   transitionFade
        
    
    **Remarks**:  
    1\. This feature is not supported for the first/main form.  
    2\. If you do not define the version key or specify any value to it other than 1.0, Iris falls back to the default behavior.
    

**transitionDuration**: Specifies the duration of the transition effect applied when the form enters the navigation stack (visible region). The default value of the parameter is 0.3 seconds. If you specify a negative value or zero for the transitionDuration parameter, the default value is set. The transitionDuration parameter is an optional parameter for the inTransitionConfig property. You can specify the transitionDuration parameter for the following transition effects:

*   transitionFade
*   transitionMoveIn
*   transitionPush
*   transitionFlip
*   transitionReveal
*   transitionCurl
*   transitionTwoSplitHorizontalIn

### Remarks

The default value for this property is voltmx.flex.FREE\_FORM.

> **_Note:_** When you set the layoutType as voltmx.flex.FREE\_FORM, when some widgets are made as invisible, you must change the widgets position to remove the empty space. Or else the space occupied by those invisible widgets will remain on the Form.

![](Resources/Images/layouttype.png)

The available options are:

*   `voltmx.flex.FREE_FORM`: The calculations for free form layout type are:  
      
    *   left is measured from the left bounds of the parent, right is measured from the right bounds of the parent and centerX measured from the left bounds of the parent.
    *   top is measured from the top bounds of the parent, bottom is measured from the bottom bounds of the parent and centerY measured from the bop bounds of the parent.
    *   For x-axis values are width, left, right, centerX in case of % units are relative to parent's width.
    *   For y-axis values are height, top, bottom, centerY in case of % units are relative to parent's height.
*   `voltmx.flex.FLOW_VERTICAL`: The calculations for vertical layout type are:  
      
    *   top is measured from bottom edge of the top sibling widget and bottom is measured from the top edge of bottom sibling widget.
    *   Vertical space between two widgets is bottom of the top sibling widget + top of the bottom sibling widget.
    *   Order of the widgets appearing in the flow is the order in which the widgets are added.
    *   left and right properties are measured from the boundaries of the parent.
*   `voltmx.flex.RESPONSIVE_GRID`: When you assign the value of the layoutType property as `voltmx.flex.RESPONSIVE_GRID`, you can assign different layouts for different breakpoints. Here are the some of the things to consider when you assign the Responsive Grid layout.  
    *   Widgets are aligned from left to right with the span and offset values provided in the Look tab of the Properties panel.
    *   You can only provide FlexContainer widget as the direct child after assigning this value to the parent.
    *   If the width of a child widget exceeds the width of the container widget, the next child widget is wrapped and placed in the next row.

### Remarks

When you set the navigationBarColor property to a form (form level), the property gets applied only to that particular form in the visible region. When a user navigates to another form, the navigation bar may change based on the properties set to that form. If the value of the navigationBarColor property is null or invalid, the value set at the application level is applied. If the navigationBarColor property is set at form level and application level, the property set at the form level overrides the property set at the application level. If the navigationBarColor property is not set at the form level and at the application level, the Android’s default settings are applied to the navigation bar.

You can define the navigation bar color in the RGBA format, where the R, G, and B range from 00 to ff, and the A (transparency) ranges from 00 (zero percent) to 64 (100 percent). The RGBA format complies with the color format generated in skins.

<details close markdown="block"><summary>outTransitionConfig Property</summary>

* * *

Specifies the type of transition effect to be applied when the Form is going out of view. It accepts hash values.

### Syntax

```

outTransitionConfig
```

### Type

JSObject

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

Following are the properties available for iPhone and iPad:

> **_Note:_** On iOS platform, Out Transition is the transition that gets applied as the form leaves the navigation stack. Every form.show either results in push into navigation stack ( enter the navigation stack) or if the form is already in stack, results popping up all the forms including the current form from the navigation stack. This is done to be in sync with the iOS native semantics of form (UIView Controller) transitions. For inTransition and outTransition, the push or pop operations are applied as below: A Form's inTransition will be played when a form is pushed inside the stack for rendering. The outTransition of the top most form in the stack will be played when the forms are popped out. For example, Form1 and Form2 are already in the stack. When you call form3.show() -> form3 will be pushed into the stack and its inTransition will be applied. The stack state after the push will be \[Form1, Form2, Form3\]. When you call form1.show() -> form2 and form3 will be popped out and form3's outTransition will be applied. The stack state after the pop will be \[Form1\].

> **_Note:_** Transition Animations are not supported when a flow of transitions from a form with AppMenu to a form without AppMenu.

**transitionDirection:** Specifies the direction from which the form must disappear in a view. You can choose one of the following options:

1.  none - Use this option if you do not want to specify a transition direction.
2.  fromRight - Specifies that the Form must disappear from the right.
3.  fromLeft - Specifies that the Form must disappear from the left.
4.  fromBottom - Specifies that the Form must disappear from the bottom.
5.  fromTop - Specifies that the Form must disappear from the top.

**transitionEffect:** Specifies the type of transition effect to be applied when the Form disappears in the view. You can choose one of the following transition effects:

1.  none - Use this option if you do not want to specify a transition direction.
2.  transitionFade - Specifies that the form must fade when it is transitioned to a hidden or an invisible state.
3.  transitionMoveIn - Specifies that the form must slide over the existing content in the direction as specified in the _transitionDirection_.
4.  transitionPush - Specifies that the form must push the existing content in the direction as specified in the _transitionDirection_ preserve">var var take its place.
5.  transitionFlip - Specifies that the form must be rotated along the Y-axis as the content is being displayed. It supports transition directions **fromRight** and **fromLeft** only.
6.  transitionReveal - Specifies that the form must be revealed gradually in the direction as specified in the _transitionDirection_.
7.  transitionCurl - Specifies that the form must be curled or folded (look and feel is similar to turning of a page in a book) as the content is being displayed. It supports transition directions **fromTop** and **fromBottom** only.
8.  transitionTwoSplitHorizontalIn - Specifies the form which is split horizontally into two parts rejoins when the transition takes place.
9.  transitionTwoSplitVerticalIn - Specifies the form which is split vertically into two parts rejoins when the transition takes place.
10.  transitionFourSplitIn - Specifies the form which is split in four parts rejoins when the transition takes place.
11.  transitionFourSplitRotateIn - Specifies the form which is split in four parts rejoins by rotating the parts when the transition takes place.
12.  transitionTwoSplitHorizontalOut - Specifies the form which is split horizontally into two parts and move away when the transition takes place.
13.  transitionTwoSplitVerticalOut - Specifies the form which is split vertically into two parts and move away when the transition takes place.
14.  transitionFourSplitRotateOut - Specifies the form which is split in four parts move away by rotating the parts when the transition takes place.
15.  transitionSwitchLeft - Specifies that the form must go out of the view in 3D circular space along the Y-axis towards left as the content is being displayed.
16.  transitionSwitchRight - Specifies that the form must go out of the view in 3D circular space along the Y-axis towards right as the content is being displayed.
17.  transitionCloth - Specifies the present form must go out of screen animating as if a cloth is removed.
18.  transitionFlipRight - Specifies that the form must be rotated along the Y-axis as the content is being displayed giving an illusion of a page is turned towards right in a book.
19.  transitionFlipLeft - Specifies that the form must be rotated along the Y-axis as the content is being displayed giving an illusion of a page is turned towards left in a book.
20.  transitionDoor - Specifies that the form must be revealed giving an illusion of a opening a door.
21.  transitionRotateExchange - Specifies that the form must be rotated along the X-axis as the content is being displayed.
22.  version - If you specify version = 1.0, the outTransitionCofig behavior of the outgoing form and the inTransitionConfig behavior of the incoming form are played out simultaneously. When version = 1.0, Iris checks for this key in the inTransitionConfig property of the form that needs this functionality. The following transitions can be played by using the version key:
    
    *   transitionMoveIn
        
    *   transitionMoveOut
        
    *   transitionFlip
        
    *   transitionReveal
        
    *   transitionFade
        
    
    **Remarks**  
    1\. This feature is not supported for the first/main form.  
    2\. If you do not define the version key or specify any value other than 1.0, Iris falls back to the default behavior.
    

**transitionDuration**: Specifies the duration of the transition effect applied when the form leaves the navigation stack (visible region). The default value of the parameter is 0.3 seconds. If you specify a negative value or zero for the transitionDuration parameter, the default value is set. The transitionDuration parameter is an optional parameter for the outTransitionConfig property. You can specify the transitionDuration parameter for the following transition effects:

*   transitionFade
*   transitionMoveIn
*   transitionPush
*   transitionFlip
*   transitionReveal
*   transitionCurl
*   transitionTwoSplitHorizontalIn
*   transitionTwoSplitVerticalIn

The statusBarColor property helps you set the color for a device's status bar.

### Syntax

```

statusBarColor
```

### Type

String

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

When you set the status bar properties to a form (form level), the properties get applied only to that particular form in the visible region. When a user navigates to another form, the status bar may change based on the properties set to that form. Otherwise, the status bar behaves based on the properties set at the application level. If the status bar properties are not set at the form level and at the application level, the device’s default settings are applied to the status bar.

> **_Note:_** The preceding paragraph is applicable for statusBarColor, statusBarForegroundColor, and statusBarHidden properties.

You can define the status bar color in the RGBA format, where the R, G, and B range from 00 to ff, and the A (transparency) ranges from 00 (zero percent) to 64 (100 percent). The RGBA format complies with the color format generated in skins.

### Example

```

Form1.statusBarColor = "ffff0000";
```

### Platform Availability

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>statusBarHidden Property</summary>

* * *

Lets you show or hide the status bar.

### Syntax

```

statusBarHidden
```

### Type

Boolean

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

*   true: hides the status bar
*   false: shows the status bar

You can achieve hidden status bar behavior by setting at Form level and at Application level as well. At the Form level, you can achieve the behavior using the statusBarHidden property, and also using the [systemUiConfig](#systemUiConfig) property with value as IMMERSIVE\_STICKY\_HIDE\_STATUS\_BAR.

When you define both statusBarHidden and systemUiConfig properties to the FlexForm, the systemUiConfig property takes the precedence irrespective of the value defined to it and the statusBarHidden property is ignored.

At the Application level, you can achieve the behavior by defining statusBarHidden parameter and the systemUiConfig parameter as well in the [voltmx.application.setApplicationProperties](../../../Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/voltmx.application_functions.md#voltmx.application.setApplicationProperties) API.

The following table provides the precedence levels when hidden status bar behavior is set using both properties (only when the systemUiConfig property's value is IMMERSIVE\_STICKY\_HIDE\_STATUS\_BAR) at the Form level and both parameters at the application level as well.

  
| Property/Parameter | Precedence Level |
| --- | --- |
| systemUiConfig Property (Form Level) | 1 |
| systemUiConfig Parameter (Application Level) | 2 |
| statusBarHidden Property (Form Level) | 3 |
| statusBarHidden Parameter (Application Level) | 4 |

> **_Note:_** Recommend you to use the systemUiConfig property at the form level to hide the status bar. Because the statusBarHidden Property has the least priority when both properties are set.

### Example

```

Form1.statusBarHidden = true;
```

### Platform Availability

*   iOS
*   Android
*   Windows

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

You can set the property at the application level and at the form level. When you set the systemUiConfig property to a form (form level), the property gets applied only to that particular form in the visible region. When a user navigates to another form, the navigation and status bars behave based on the property value set to that form. If the value of the systemUiConfig property is null or invalid, the value set at the application level is applied. If the systemUiConfig property is set at both form level and application level, the property set at the form level overrides the property set at the application level. If the systemUiConfig property is not set at the form level and at the application level, Android’s default immersive mode settings are applied.

You can define any one of the following modes:

_SYSTEM\_UI\_DEFAULT_: Resets any of the following modes set previously.

_DIM\_SYSTEM\_BARS_: Dims the status and navigation bars, and space occupied them retained as is.

_HIDE\_STATUS\_BAR_: Hides the status bar, and the space occupied by the status bar is not retained. A user can make the status bar visible by swiping down from the top of the screen or by tapping anywhere on the screen.

_HIDE\_NAVIGATION\_BAR_: Hides the navigation bar. The space occupied by the navigation bar is not retained. A user can make the navigation bar visible by swiping up from the bottom of the screen or by tapping anywhere on the screen.

_HIDE\_SYSTEM\_BARS_: Hides the status and navigation bars. The space occupied by the bars is not retained. A user can make the bars visible by swiping down from the top of the screen, by swiping up from the bottom of the screen, or by tapping anywhere on the screen.

_HIDE\_STATUS\_BAR\_KEEP\_LAYOUT\_STABLE_: Hides the status bar, and space occupied by the bar is retained. To reset this mode, follow the steps in HIDE\_STATUS\_BAR.

_HIDE\_NAVIGATION\_BAR\_KEEP\_LAYOUT\_STABLE_: Hides the navigation bar, and space occupied by the bar is retained. To reset this mode, follow the steps in HIDE\_NAVIGATION\_BAR.

_HIDE\_SYSTEM\_BARS\_KEEP\_LAYOUT\_STABLE_: Hides the status and navigation bars, and the space occupied by the bars is retained. To reset this mode, follow the steps in HIDE\_SYSTEM\_BARS.

_IMMERSIVE\_HIDE\_STATUS\_BAR_: Hides the status bar, and the space occupied by the bar is not retained. Unlike HIDE\_STATUS\_BAR, this mode can be reset only when a user makes the status bar visible by swiping down from the top of the screen.

_IMMERSIVE\_HIDE\_NAVIGATION\_BAR_: Hides the navigation bar, and the space occupied by the bar is not retained. Unlike HIDE\_NAVIGATION\_BAR, this mode can be reset only when a user makes the navigation bar visible by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.

_IMMERSIVE\_HIDE\_STATUS\_BAR\_KEEP\_LAYOUT\_STABLE_: Hides the status bar, and the space occupied by the bar is retained. To reset this mode, follow the steps in IMMERSIVE\_HIDE\_STATUS\_BAR.

_IMMERISIVE\_HIDE\_NAVIGATION\_BAR\_KEEP\_LAYOUT\_STABLE_: Hides the navigation bar, and the space occupied by the bar is retained. To reset this mode, follow the steps in IMMERSIVE\_HIDE\_NAVIGATION\_BAR.

_IMMERSIVE\_HIDE\_SYSTEM\_BARS_: Hides the status and navigation bars, and the space occupied by the bars is not retained. Unlike HIDE\_SYSTEM\_BARS, the mode can be reset only when a user makes the bars visible by swiping down from the top of the screen or swiping up from the bottom of the screen.

_IMMERSIVE\_HIDE\_SYSTEM\_BARS\_KEEP\_LAYOUT\_STABLE_: Hides the status and navigation bars. The space occupied by the bars is retained. To reset this mode, follow the steps in IMMERSIVE\_HIDE\_SYSTEM\_BARS.

_IMMERSIVE\_STICKY\_HIDE\_STATUS\_BAR_: Hides the status bar, and the space occupied by the bar is not retained. A user cannot reset the mode. When a user swipes down from the top of the screen, the status bar appears momentarily and disappears.

_IMMERSIVE\_STICKY\_HIDE\_STATUS\_BAR\_KEEP\_LAYOUT\_STABLE_: Hides the status bar, and the space occupied by the bar is retained. A user cannot reset the mode. When a user swipes down from the top of the screen, the status bar appears momentarily and disappears.

_IMMERSIVE\_STICKY\_HIDE\_NAVIGATION\_BAR_: Hides the navigation bar, and the space occupied by the bar is not retained. A user cannot reset the mode. When a user swipes up from the bottom of the screen, the navigation bar appears momentarily and disappears.

_IMMERSIVE\_STICKY\_HIDE\_NAVIGATION\_BAR\_KEEP\_LAYOUT\_STABLE_: Hides the navigation bar, and the space occupied by the bar is retained. A user cannot reset this mode. When a user swipes up from the bottom of the screen, the navigation bar appears momentarily and disappears.

_IMMERSIVE\_STICKY\_HIDE\_SYSTEM\_BARS_: Hides the status and navigation bars, and the space occupied by the bars is not retained. A user cannot reset the mode. System bars appear momentarily when a user tries to make the bars visible by swiping down from the top of the screen or by swiping upward from the bottom of the screen.

_IMMERSIVE\_STICKY\_HIDE\_SYSTEM\_BARS\_KEEP\_LAYOUT\_STABLE_: Hides the status and navigation bars, and the space occupied by the bars is retained. System bars appear momentarily when a user tries to make the bars visible by swiping down from the top of the screen or by swiping up from the bottom of the screen.

> **_Note:_** The systemUIConfig flag is cleared when you move the application to the background and then bring it back to the foreground. So, the status bar/navigation bar is displayed by default when you move the application back to the foreground.

Rather, the contents of the Form are automatically panned so that the current focus is never obscured by the keyboard and users can always see what they are typing. This is generally less desirable than resizing, because the user may need to close the soft keyboard to get at and interact with obscured parts of the Form.

The below image illustrates the above two options:

<details close markdown="block"><summary>zIndex Property</summary>

* * *

This property specifies the stack order of a widget. A widget with a higher zIndex is always in front of a widget with a lower zIndex.

The zIndex property is used to set the stack, or layer order of a widget. Widgets with higher values will appear “over”, or “on top of” widgets with lower values. Widgets layered over other widgets will override any interaction events tied to widgets beneath. Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets in the Volt MX Iris hierarchy, inside of a flexContainer or form. The zIndex property accepts only positive values.

### Syntax

```

zIndex
```

### Type

Number

### Read/Write

Read + Write

### Remarks

The default value for this property is 1.

> **_Note:_** Modifying the zIndex does not modify the order of the widgets inside the FlexContainer. If zIndex is same for group of overlapping widgets then widget order decides the order of overlapping. The last added widget is displayed on top.

From Volt MX Iris V9 SP2 FP7, developers can configure the Z Index value for a Responsive Web app as **Auto** or **Custom**. When the selected Z Index value is **Auto**, the default Z Index value of 1 is applied. When the selected Z Index value is **Custom**, developers can specify a desired numeric value.

Prior to the V9 SP2 FP7 release, the default value for the Z Index was **1**. When developers imported any third-party libraries with the Z index set as **Auto**, content overflow was disabled as the value of Auto is less than 1.

> **_Note:_** The Z Index value Auto is supported only when the Enable JS Library mode is configured as unchecked.

For existing components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Custom** with **1** as the value.

For new components, the value of the Z Index is configured as **1** for the Native channel. For the Responsive Web channel, the Z Index will be set as **Auto** or **1** based on the project level settings.

> **_Note:_** If ModalContainer property is set to true in any of the FlexContainer widget, the Z Index value of that container and all of its parent containers should be set to **Custom**.

**voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO** : Constant to configure the Z Index value as **auto** programmatically.

```

//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto  
 var flx = new voltmx.ui.FlexContainer({ 
  "id": "flx"
  "zIndex": voltmx.flex.ZINDEX_AUTO
});

```

```

//Sample code to set the ZIndex value to Auto
flx.zIndex = voltmx.flex.ZINDEX\_AUTO;

```

### Example

```

//Sample code to set the zIndex property for widgets.  
frmHome.widgetID.zIndex = 300;
```

*   Available in the IDE
*   iOS, Android, Windows, SPA, and Desktop Web
