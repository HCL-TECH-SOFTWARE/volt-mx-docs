Toolbar Widget
==============

The Toolbar Widget allows you to add native iOS toolbars to your application. This widget is applicable for the iOS platform only.

A toolbar appears at the bottom of a application and contains context sensitive buttons for performing actions relevant to the current form. Toolbars are translucent, may have a background tint, and can be hidden when the user is unlikely to need them. Use a toolbar when navigation isn’t needed, or you want multiple controls for managing content. If navigation is needed, consider using an app menu.

Don't use a toolbar and an app menu on the same form. If you do this, the app menu items appear at the bottom of the form and the toolbar shows above app menu items.

Following are real-time use cases of Tool Bar widget:

*   In music apps, tool bar is used to display controls such as play, pause, skip, etc.,
    
*   In social networking apps, tool bar can be used to display icons for the actions such as deleting a specific message and composing a new message.
    

For more information see the [Toolbars](https://developer.apple.com/ios/human-interface-guidelines/ui-bars/toolbars/) topic in Apple's developer documentation.
