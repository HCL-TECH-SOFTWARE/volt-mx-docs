The voltmx.application.addApplicationCallbacks API helps you to register multiple callbacks for the same event. This API is available from V9 SP2 onwards.

### Syntax

voltmx.application.addApplicationCallbacks(callbacksMap)

### Input Parameters

callbacksMap \[Object\] - Mandatory

Specifies an Object with key as **appstate** and value as the Map Object (key with value as callback function) for the corresponding appstate. The following appstates are applicable:

  
| App state | Description |
| --- | --- |
| isAppLaunchedForInteraction | State which indicates that the application is visible to users for interaction. isAppLaunchedForInteraction is triggered only once in the lifecycle of the app. If the app is already visible to the user by the time the callback is registered, it is immediately triggered irrespective of whether the app is in the foreground or the background. If the same key is used again, you need to throw a "#APP\_STATE# callback with #CALLBACK\_ID # key already exists" error message. For example, consider a scenario where the isAppLaunchedForInteraction callback with xyz key already exists. If the callbackID is removed or the callback for that respective callbackID is already executed, a duplicate error message is not displayed if the user tries to add the callback with the same callbackID. |

<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.application.beginBackgroundTask</summary>

* * *

In some scenarios apps are launched in the background to perform some long running task. A typical example, could be when a watch app requests its parent app (phone app) for some information, the phone app is launched in the background. If the phone app needs to run a long running task in order to serve the requirement of the watch app, it is recommended to start a background task. This API ensures iOS does not suspend the phone app when running in the background that take too much time or resources for execution.

This API is used when you want to run a long running or the asynchronous task in the background of the phone app. When the long running task is completed, you must end the background task using the API voltmx.application.endBackgroundTask.

### Syntax

```

voltmx.application.beginBackgroundTask(taskID, callback)
```

### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| taskID \[String\] - Mandatory | Specifies the unique identifier for the task. |
| callback \[function\] - Optional | Specifies the callback that gets executed in the background before iOS suspends the app. You can use this callback to save information or clean up resources before your app gets suspended. |

 
### Example

```

function ExpirationHandlercallback(){  
//your logic to clear resources or save data.  
} function jsfunction(userInfo, replyObj){

    var taskID = voltmx.application.beginBackgroundTask("TaskName", ExpirationHandlercallback);

    //Long running task.

    voltmx.application.endbackgroundTask(taskID);

}
```

### Return Values

This API returns taskID as a number that is used as an input for voltmx.application.endBackgroundTask API.

### Platform Availability

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.application.openApplicationSettings</summary>

* * *

Opens the application-specific settings or device-level application settings.

You may need to direct the end-user to application settings to manually enable or disable a permission for the app to access a particular resource. This function is required when the end-user had denied the permission when the app prompted with a dialog box, and later wants the app to access the resource. For example, if your app wants to access the user's contacts - so the app displayed a dialog box with "Allow" and "Deny" options, asking end-user to grant permission for the first time. The end-user tapped the "Deny" option and the app cannot access the user's contacts. Later, after some point of time, if end-user wants the app access the user's contacts; at that time, you can call the openApplicationSettings API that allows the user to navigate to the application settings screen, and then grant the required permission to the app.

The behavior of the openApplicationSettings API in different platforms:

*   **Windows**: There is no provision to open the application-level settings. The openApplicationSettings API accepts the resourceid as an optional parameter that helps open the resource-specific settings screen. If the resourceid is not provided, results in unexpected behavior.
*   **iOS**: Opens the application-level settings screen showing the access status of the resource. The end-user can turn on or off the access to the resource from the app. The resourceid parameter is ignored in the iOS platform.
*   **Android**: Opens the application-level settings screen showing the access status of the resource. The end-user can turn on or off the access to the resource from the app. The resourceid parameter is ignored in the iOS platform.

### Syntax

```

voltmx.application.openApplicationSettings(resourceId\[const\])
```

### Input Parameters

| Function | Description |
| --- | --- |
| resourceId \[constant\] - Optional | Specify the resource ID of the resource that you want open its settings. The parameter works only for Windows. For more information, refer to Resource ID. |

### Example

```

voltmx.application.openApplicationSettings(voltmx.os.RESOURCE_CONTACTS);

<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.application.postAccessibilityNotification</summary>

* * *

This API posts a notification to "assistive" applications, i.e., applications that are designed to increase accessibility for blind and low-vision users, as well as for users with dyslexia.

Your application may need to post accessibility notifications if you have user interface (UI) components that change very frequently or ones that appear and disappear. Examples of such UI components include widgets that can be hidden or made visible in the layout on the click of a button.

Every Volt MX Iris Widget contains the VoiceOver accessibility feature, i.e., a voice-over that reads the titles of Volt MX Iris Widgets once a notification is posted.

Accessibility is directly managed by native iOS, and users don't have the control to set the focus, especially in Browser widgets. As a result, whenever a screen changes, the accessibility control sometimes remains in the previous screen. So, in order to set the focus of accessibility to the new screen, this API is used to notify the operating system that the screen has changed.

### Syntax

```

voltmx.application.postAccessibilityNotification(config);
```

### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| config - Mandatory | This is a jsdict. config\[jsdictionary\] accessibilityNotificationName\[const\] - Mandatory Here, the constant (const) specifies the type of notification that the app can send. **constants.ACCESSIBILITY\_SCREENCHANGED\_NOTIFICATION** This is posted by the app when a new view appears that takes up a major portion of the screen. |

### Example

```

voltmx.application.postAccessibilityNotification({
accessibilityNotificationName:constants.ACCESSIBILITY_SCREENCHANGED_NOTIFICATION});
```

### Return Values

None

<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.application.registerForIdleTimeout</summary> 

* * *

This API specifies if the application must timeout after a defined period of inactivity (time difference between the current device time and the last time you clicked on any user interface component) and also specifies the action after the timeout interval.

> **_Important:_** 
*   You must enable the forms for idletimeout by setting the property for **enabledForIdleTimeout** as _True_ in the IDE. The _idletimeout_ event is triggered only when the user is on a form that is enabled for idletimeout.
*   When the idletimeout event is triggered, the user is navigated to the home screen with an alert message.
*   In BJS devices, to validate registerForIdleTimeout, an event must be triggered once time out is occurred.

### Use Case

You can use this API typically in financial applications when you want to log the user out automatically after a specific period of inactivity. This way, you can ensure that there is no un-authorized access to the application or to the sensitive information like account number, credit card numbers, and so on.

### Syntax

```

voltmx.application.registerForIdleTimeout([timeoutValue](#timeoutValue), [callback](#callback))
```

### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| timeoutValue \[Number\] - Mandatory | The timeout value in minutes. |
| callback \[Function\] - Mandatory | The function that must be executed after the timeout has occurred. The callback function has the logic to display the current form. The function can be changed during runtime. |

> **_Note:_** Current form is the Form that was being displayed on the device screen when the timeout occurred.

### Example

```

function test() {
    //Logic for the callback function registerForIdleTimeout
}

function registerForIdleTimeout() {
    voltmx.application.registerForIdleTimeout(1, test);
}
```

### Return Values

None

### Implementation Details

The _idletimeout_ event is triggered only once for every call to `registerForIdleTimeout` API and this event is not fired again until the next call to the API. The _idletimeout_ event unregisters itself automatically when the event is fired. When the event unregisters itself, the application can register again for idletimeout.

### The following are a few scenarios:

#### Scenario 1

_idletimeout_ event is triggered after the specified time interval, but the user is on a form that is not enabled for idletimeout. In this case, the function associated with the event is executed as soon as the user navigates to the form that is enabled for idletimeout.

> **_Note:_** In this case, the form that the user is trying to navigate to is never shown as the idletimeout event takes precedence.

#### Scenario 2

_idletimeout_ event is triggered and the user is on a form enabled for idletimeout. In this case, the associated function is executed immediately.

#### Scenario 3

The application is registered for idle time out and the user tries to register again for idletimeout. In this case, the latter call to the `registerForIdleTimeout` API has no affect and is ignored.

#### Scenario 4

The application is registered for idletimeout but none of the forms in the application are enabled for idletimeout. In this case, this API has no affect and the behavior of the application is undefined.

Each underlying platform handles the _idletimeout_ event differently:

**iPhone**

*   When the application is running in the background, no logic is executed. However, the timers keep running and the idletimeout event is triggered in the background. But the function is executed immediately when the application comes to foreground.
    
> **_Note:_** When the application comes to foreground, you will suddenly notice the function of the idletimeout event getting executed.
    
**Android**

*   When you press the device Back button to go out of the application, the underlying OS destroys the UI activity. In such cases, the idletimeout event is fired only when the application comes to the foreground.
*   When you navigate out of the application using the device Home button, the underlying OS pauses the UI activity but does not destroy it. In such cases, the idletimeout event is fired immediately in the background.

**Mobile Web**

*   In Mobile Web applications, the timer is not active when the application goes into background or sleep mode. When the application comes into foreground, the timer starts running and the `idletimeout` triggers after the specified time interval.

### Rules and Restrictions

This API is applicable only when the Form property _Enable Time Out_ is set to _true_. For more information about _Enable Time Out_ property, see _VoltMX IrisWidget User Guide_.

### Exceptions

An error is thrown if input is invalid or does not follow the expected structure.

102-Invalid input error

<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.application.registerOnSettingsChangeCallback</summary>

* * *

Customers can use the registerOnSettingsChangeCallback API to listen in Volt MX applications, if any settings have been changed in Native settings applications. Users can pass the list of required settings in the first parameter. In addition, users can pass the callback, which is invoked when any required setting is changed, in the second parameter. The callback is invoked with parameters, which provide information about the setting that was changed and the values of said setting. If users want to stop listening to changes in the settings, they must successfully register and pass null in the second parameter as well as pass the list of settings that they want to stop listening in the first parameter.

### Syntax

```

voltmx.application.registerOnSettingsChangeCallback(settingsList,callback)
```

### Input Parameters

**settingsList\[JSONObject\]- Mandatory**

The list of settings that users want to listen must be provided in this parameter. It can have one or more values. Following are the settings supported by various platforms:

*   Android: "location", "device\_locale", "time\_zone", "time", and "wifi".
*   Windows: "font", "color", "advancedEffectsEnabled", and "inputLanguage".

**callback\[Function object\] - Mandatory**

The callback to be invoked when there is a change in any setting that is passed in the first parameter. This callback must be passed in the second parameter. This is the single function for all the settings. It can have function object or null value. Function object is passed for listening to settings and null value is passed to stop listening to setting changes. If any registered setting changes, the callback is invoked with JS object. This object contains information about the changed setting. Depending on the setting that is changed, the JS object can have different keys. Following are the various keys that JS object can contain:

*   Windows

  
| Settings | Description |
| --- | --- |
| font (key) | This key has value as "textScaleFactor". It informs that the system Text Size setting has been changed. |
| color (key) | This key has null value, you must invoke the API to get the values. |
| advancedEffectsEnabled (key) | This key has "value". It indicates whether the system Transparency Effects setting has been enabled (True/False). |
| inputLanguage (key) | This key has "value". It informs when the current input language has been changed. |


*   Android

| Settings | Description |
| --- | --- |
| location | If "location" setting changes, the JS object passed to the callback has the following key values:setting (key): This key has value as "location", which informs that the "location" setting has been changed.gps\_provider (key) : This key has value as "true"/"false", which informs that the gps\_provider has been enabled/disabled.network\_provider (key): This key has value as "true"/"false", which informs that the network\_provider has been enabled/disabled. |
| device\_locale | If the "device\_locale" setting changes, the JS object passed to the callback has the following key values:setting (key): This key has value as "device\_locale", which informs that the "device\_locale" setting has been changed.device\_locale (key): This key has new device locale value, which is changed from the application device settings. |
| time\_zone | If the "time\_zone" setting changes, the JS object passed to the callback has the following key values:setting (key): This key has value as "time\_zone", which informs that the "time\_zone" setting has been changed.time\_zone (key): This key has new time zone value, that is changed from the application device settings. |
| time | If the "time" setting changes, the JS object is passed to the callback has the following key value:setting (key): This key has value as "time", which informs that the "time" setting has been changed. |
| wifi | If the "wifi" setting changes, the JS object passed to the callback has the following key values:setting (key): This key has value as "wifi", which informs that the "wifi" setting has been changed.wifi\_current\_state (key): This key has value as current wifi state value.wifi\_previous\_state (key): This key has value as previous wifi state value.The list of wifi states is as follows:voltmx.settings.WIFI\_DISABLING: Wifi is disabling. Constant Value: 0 voltmx.settings.WIFI\_DISABLED: Wifi is disabled. Constant Value: 1 voltmx.settings.WIFI\_ENABLING: Wifi is enabling. Constant Value: 2 voltmx.settings.WIFI\_ENABLED: Wifi is enabled. Constant Value: 3 voltmx.settings.WIFI\_UNKNOWN: Wifi state is unknown. Constant Value: 4> **_Note:_** If you invoke the registerOnSettingsChangeCallback API with "wifi" setting, the callback is invoked immediately with setting key as "wifi". This occurs because of native behavior. |

### Example

```

function callback(params) {
    switch (params.setting) {
        case "location":
            alert(params.gps_provider);

<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.application.requestIgnoreBatteryOptimizations</summary> 

* * *

This API displays a dialog box with the ALLOW and DENY options to control the battery optimization state for an app, without having to open the device settings.

If the user selects the **ALLOW** option, the app is added to the power white-list of the device.

If the user selects the **DENY** option (or taps the back arrow in the dialog box), the app is not added to the power white-list of the device, and the white-list status of the app does not change.

> **_Note:_**
*   Before you invoke the voltmx.application.requestIgnoreBatteryOptimizationsAPI, invoke the [voltmx.application.isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations](#isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations) to determine if an application is already ignoring battery optimizations.
*   Ensure that you add the REQUEST\_IGNORE\_BATTERY\_OPTIMIZATIONS permission in the Android Manifest file of the project.
*   Most applications must not use battery optimizations as the platform provides various facilities for applications to operate as expected in different power-saving modes. You must only use this API in specific applications that need to complete control for execution, at the potential expense of the device's battery life. These applications might display the high power usage notification to the users.  
    When you use the REQUEST\_IGNORE\_BATTERY\_OPTIMIZATIONS permission without a proper use-case or a usage justification, the Google Play Store may reject the application upload.

Here are a few real-time use-cases that may need exclusion from power optimization to avoid problems in Doze mode:

*   Data synchronization apps such as Google Photos (that back up photos to the cloud), Field Services applications (that need the latest data to be synchronized with the server).  
    Battery optimization in these apps may cause delays in sync and loss of data from the device in case the device is damaged or lost.
*   Real-time message communication apps such as WhatsApp, Telegram, SMS, etc.  
    Battery optimization in these apps may cause a delay in receiving message notifications.
*   VPN apps.  
    Battery optimization in these apps may cause VPNs to drop the connection when the display of the phone is off.
*   Time-sensitive apps such as SMS schedulers.  
    Battery optimization in these apps may result in a failure to send the scheduled messages on time.

### Syntax

```

voltmx.application.requestIgnoreBatteryOptimizations(callback)
```

### Input Parameters
 
| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| callback - Optional | The callback function to be invoked when the user selects the ‘ALLOW’ or 'DENY' option in the dialog box. The signature of the callback function is callback(code), where code is a Battery Optimization Response Code.For information on the codes, refer [Battery Optimization Response Codes](#Battery). |

### Example

```

function requestIgnoreBatteryOptimizations() {  
	voltmx.application.requestIgnoreBatteryOptimizations(dialogActionCallback);  
},  
function dialogActionCallback(code)  
{  
    if(code == voltmx.application.IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS_ACCEPTED)  
    {  
      //This code indicates that the user has pressed Allow on the Ignore Battery optimiation dialog.  
    }  
    else if(code == voltmx.application.IGNORE_BATTERY_OPTIMIZATIONS_REQUEST_CANCELLED)  
    {  
      //This code indicates that the user has denied the Ignore Battery optimiation dialog.This response code may sent to callback even when your application is already ignoring battery optimizations.  
    }   
}
```

### Return Values

None

### Remarks

*   The voltmx.application.requestIgnoreBatteryOptimizations API is only supported on Android devices with OS API level 23, and later.
*   Ensure that you set the value of the `enableBatteryOptimizationAPI` property to **true** in the `androidbuild.properties` file to enable this API.
*   The voltmx.application.requestIgnoreBatteryOptimizations API will not invoke a system dialog if an application is already ignoring battery optimizations.
*   If you invoke the voltmx.application.isIgnoringBatteryOptimizations API when the application is running in the background, the dialog box may not be displayed on the device.

Battery Optimization Response Codes

| Code | Description |
| --- | --- |
| voltmx.application.IGNORE\_BATTERY\_OPTIMIZATIONS\_ACCEPTED | Indicates that the user has selected **Allow** in the Ignore Battery optimization dialog box. |
| voltmx.application.IGNORE\_BATTERY\_OPTIMIZATIONS\_REQUEST\_CANCELLED | Indicates that the user has denied the Ignore Battery optimization in the dialog box.This response code may also be sent to the callback when the application is already ignoring battery optimizations. |

<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.application.setApplicationBehaviors</summary>

* * *

The `voltmx.application.setApplicationBehaviors` function enables your app to configure its response to various events.

### Syntax

```

voltmx.application.setApplicationBehaviors(  
    Objectbehaviors);
```

### Input Parameters

Objectbehaviors

A JavaScript object that contains key-value pairs which specify the app's response to various events. The object includes the following key-value pairs.

 
| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| adherePercentageStrictly | By default, this key is set to `true`. This property is supported on SPA and Desktop Web only. |
| backOnEsc | If set to `true`, allows the user to go back to previous form by pressing Escape key. If the user is on the first form, the operation is ignored. Default value is `false`. If you are using the `onDeviceBack` property on the form, the app will override the `backOnEsc` property and gives priority to `onDeviceBack` property. Available on only Windows. |
| blurEffectStyleInBackground | A value from the [Blur Effect Constants](constants_namespace.md#BLUREFFECT) that blurs the app's most recent screen when it is in the background. This value is ignored if the value of the `enableSplashScreen` key is `true`. |
| breakpoints | Sets the various breakpoints for the form for responsive web design. |
| calendarMonthYearSelectionDropdownView | This property is used to set the Calendar widget popup to the new(dropdown) view. If the value of this attribute is true, the Calendar widget will be displayed in the new(dropdown) look. The default value of this key is false. This property is supported on Desktop Web only. > **_Note:_** If an app is developed on V9 SP2 GA, you can’t change the Calendar widget popup to the old view. However, if an app is developed V9 SP1 GA or before and is imported into V9 SP2 GA, the calendar widget popup will be in the old(grid) view, to change it to a new(dropdown) look, you should change the property to true.**Ex**. voltmx.application.setApplicationBehaviors({ “calendarMonthYearSelectionDropdownView” : true }); |
| defaultIndicatorColor | Sets the color for the progress indicator. A Hex code or a word can be used to set the color. The words can only be used for two colors (white and grey), and these words are not case sensitive. The `defaultIndicatorColor` key is only supported on Android and Windows. The default color might vary for each platform as it picks from the application's theme, form color or predefined colors. |
| dismissSIPinCallbacks | Enables users to dismiss the soft inputs such as keyboard and rotating wheel from the mobile screen. Using the `dismissSIPinCallbacks` key, users can dismiss the soft inputs when a registered callback such as onClick or onDownload is invoked for a corresponding widget. This property is available only on the iOS platform. Following are the possible values of the `dismissSIPinCallbacks` key: DISMISS\_SIP\_IN\_CALLBACKS\_DEFAULT: The native iOS Volt MX IrisFramework determines if a soft input will be dismissed on invoking a registered callback. DISMISS\_SIP\_IN\_CALLBACKS\_YES: A soft input is dismissed after a registered callback is triggered for a widget. DISMISS\_SIP\_IN\_CALLBACKS\_NO: A soft input is not dismissed. Users must close the control such as a keyboard explicitly by clicking on the cancel or done buttons. > **_Note:_** Users can set the `dismissSIPinCallbacks` property multiple times in an application. Example:voltmx.application.setApplicationBehaviors( { "dismissSIPinCallbacks": constants.DISMISS\_SIP\_IN\_CALLBACKS\_NO } ) |
| enableLazyLoadForSegment | A Boolean value that, when set to `true`, enables lazy loading for the data of the segment rows. When lazy loading is enabled for a segment, the data in the rows is loaded only when required. Lazy loading improves the performance of a segment as all the data is not loaded simultaneously. > **_Important:_** The lazy loading feature is only available for Segments present in a Responsive Web App that is built in the CSS Library mode (with the **Enable JS Library Mode (Legacy)** option disabled in the Project Settings). If the **Enable JS Library Mode (Legacy)** option is enabled for the app, the lazy loading feature does not work at run-time, and the [loadingPlaceholderImage](#loadingPlaceholderImage) property does not appear. > **_Note:_** From Volt MX Iris V9 ServicePack 3, the default value set for this parameter is **TRUE**. If you want to disable the lazy loading experience for a Segment, set the value of the `enableLazyLoadForSegment` parameter to **FALSE**. As Lazy loading only loads selective segment rows, the row animations and the onRowDisplay event callbacks are only triggered for the segment rows that are loaded. > **_Note:_** Support for this property has been introduced in the Volt MX Iris V9 ServicePack 2 Fixpack 7 release. |
| enableNSURLSession | A Boolean value that, when set to `true`, sets all network requirements to be served with NSURLSession. Setting this to `false` restores the current behavior which uses NSURLConnection. |
| enableRedrawRegions | A Boolean value that enables redraw regions when set to `true`, or disables them when set to `false`. The default is `true`. Available on only Windows. |
| enableSplashScreen | A Boolean value that causes a splash screen to be displayed when the app is in the background when set to `true`, or disables the splash screen when set to `false`. The default is `true`. Available on iOS. |
| filterTouchesWhenObscured | Tap jacking is a technique that is used by hackers to steal sensitive data by using a screen overlay mechanism. For example, a hacker can place a textbox over the password textbox in a login page by using the screen overlay mechanism. When an app user enters some data in the password text box, the data is actually entered in the textbox placed by the hacker and relays the information to the hacker. The filterTouchesWhenObscured parameter is a Boolean value that, when set to true, protects the application from Tap jacking security issues. When a screen overlay is present, this property filters the touch propagation to the app screen. The default value of this parameter is `false`. > **_Note:_** This parameter is only available on the Android. Example:voltmx.application.setApplicationBehaviors({ "filterTouchesWhenObscured": true}); |
| fontScaleFactor | A Boolean value that sets the scale factor in pre/post app init. When configured, fonts in the app will scale accordingly. Configure this only once in the app life cycle to avoid ambiguous behavior. JavaScrip developers must add the following snippet in pre/post init. Example:  var deviceInfo = voltmx.os.deviceInfo(); if (deviceInfo\["model"\] == "iPhone 6 Plus") { voltmx.application.setApplicationBehaviors( {fontScaleFactor:2.25} ); } else if (deviceInfo\["model"\] == "iPhone 6") { voltmx.application.setApplicationBehaviors( {fontScaleFactor:1.24} ); } else if(deviceInfo\["model"\] == "iPhone 5C") { voltmx.application.setApplicationBehaviors( {fontScaleFactor:0.98} ); } |
| hideDefaultLoadingIndicator | A Boolean value that hides the loading indicator when set to `true`, or shows it when set to `false`. |
| hideDefaultLoadingIndicator | A Boolean value that, if set to `true`, hides the default loading indicator that appears when a background operation is performed. The `hideDefaultLoadingIndicator` key is available only on Android and it is supported from Volt MX Android plug-in GA 5.0.32 onwards. |
| hideStatusBar | A Boolean value that hides the status bar when set to `true`, or shows it when set to `false`. The hideStatusBar property is available only on Windows (8 and later versions) and it is supported in Volt MX Iris GA 5.6.4.11 and in GA 6.0.2.3. |
| invokePreshowPostShowEventsOnDeviceBack | A Boolean value that selects whether the pre-show or post-show events are triggered when the user presses the **Back** option on a device. |
| isGestureEventsAsync | A Boolean value that specifies that all gesture events are executed asynchronously when your app sets this value to `true`. Otherwise, they are executed synchronously. Available on only Windows. |
| isI18nLayoutConfigEnabled | A Boolean value that enables or disables the layout mirroring support for Volt MX Iris Applications. It is a global application-level parameter. This parameter is passed as an input for the voltmx.application.setApplicationBehaviors API, and is available from V9 SP2 onwards. If you assign the isI18nLayoutConfigEnabled key as **false**, the layout mirroring feature of your application is disabled. If you assign the isI18nLayoutConfigEnabled key as **true**, the layout mirroring feature of your application is enabled. Available on Windows, iOS, Android, and SPA. For Windows, if you use the **isI18nLayoutConfigEnabled** key and the **voltmx.application.setApplicationLayout** API together in a single application, the application does not function as expected. |
| isLowLevelEventsAsync | A Boolean value that specifies that the  `onTouchStart`, `onTouchMove`, `onTouchEnd` , and `onTouchCancel` events are executed asynchronously when your app sets this value to `true`. Otherwise, they are executed synchronously. Available on only Windows. |
| isPopupModel | A Boolean value that specifies whether the pop-up is modal. The value set as the property for a pop-up takes precedence over the value set dynamically. |
| isScrollEventsAsync | A Boolean value that, if set to `true`, indicates that scroll events are executed asynchronously. Volt MX Iris recommends that you set this value to `false` and execute the scroll events synchronously. Available on only Windows. |
| marginsIncludedInWidgetContainerWeight | A Boolean value that applies the margin calculations when set to `true`. Margins are calculated based on width of the parent box. |
| maxHeight | A numeric value that allows your app to set maximum height of the main window. Available only on Windows. |
| maxWidth | A numeric value that allows your app to set maximum width of the main window. Available only on Windows. |
| minHeight | A numeric value that allows your app to set minimum height of the main window. Available only on Windows. |
| minWidth | A numeric value that allows your app to set minimum width of the main window. Available only on Windows. |
| popupAsDialog | A Boolean value that, when set to `true`, forces all the pop-ups to be displayed outside the main window. If set to `false`, pop-ups are displayed embedded in main window. The default value is `false`. Available only on Windows. |
| prefersHomeIndicatorAutoHidden (available only from iOS 11) | A Boolean value that specifies to auto hide the virtual home indicator that is introduced in iPhoneX bezel less display. This virtual home indicator is used instead of the physical home button. Apple takes care of when to auto hide the virtual home indicator if the value is set to true. The default value is false. **Sample code**: function setHomeInidicatorAutoHidden(){ voltmx.application.setApplicationBehaviors( {"prefersHomeIndicatorAutoHidden" : true} ); } |
| restoreformstateondeviceback | A Boolean value that specifies whether the default behavior of form app menu state is retained when the user presses the Back button on the device. |
| retainSpaceOnHide | A Boolean value that specifies whether the space allocated for a widget is retained when the widget is made invisible. For more information, see the **[Remarks](#retainSpaceOnHide)** section below. |
| saveState | If set to `true`, location and size of the main window will be saved between application session. Default is `false`. If the `setApplicationBehaviour` function is called multiple times, latest settings are considered and all old settings are overridden. Available on only Windows. |
| settings | A JavaScript Dictionary object that contains key-value pairs. For more information, see the **[Remarks](#settings)** section below. Available on only Windows. |
| skinImageScaleMode | A value from the [Skin Image Scale Mode Constants](constants_namespace.md#SkinImageScaleMode).Available only on Windows. |
| skipEscapeHTML | A Boolean value that allows HTML tags in Label widgets when set to `true`, or disallows them when set to `false`. |
| useNativeMSG | A Boolean value that, when set to `true`, enables your app to use native multistep gradients that are scaled relative to the size of the widget. Otherwise, set to `false` to disable this behavior. |

### Return Values

None.

### Remarks

This function enables you to specify whether:

> *   The pre-show and post-show events are invoked if you press Back option on a mobile device.
> *   Pop-ups are modal.
> *   The app menu needs to be updated when the pre-show and post-show events are invoked if you press the Back option on a mobile device.

Your app's menu has to be configured in pre-show/post show of each form if each form has separate app menu buttons or items. But on some platforms, the pre-show and post-show events are triggered when the user navigates back using Back option. On other platforms, those events are not triggered. If the pre-show/post-show event is not triggered, the form cannot update its app menu. In this scenario, ideally, the form must retain its app menu which it set earlier.

To ensure consistency while porting applications across platforms, the `voltmx.application.setApplicationBehaviors` function enables you to set the default behavior of pre-show and post-show events, a pop-up, and app menu.

> **_Note:_** This function can only be called in the post-appinit event handler.

### Parameter Details

The following provides more information about the key-value pairs in the _Objectbehaviors_ parameter.

**retainSpaceOnHide**

This key is applicable to widgets placed in a percentage container.

Limitations in Windows channel: When retainSpaceOnHide is true and widget isVisible property is false, top, and bottom margins will not be considered for invisible widget.When visibility of widget is changed and when retainSpaceOnHide is True, there must not be any change in the width of HBox or % scrollBox.

Height changes to the max height of the visible child widget.When retainSpaceOnHide property is made False, inconsistency among platforms is observed. If any of the widgets placed inside a container are made invisible, then some platforms will retain the space and some platforms will not retain the space. To overcome this inconsistency or to retain the space in all platforms, retainSpaceOnHide property must be configured to True. The default value of retainSpaceOnHide property is True.

**settings**

The value for this key is a JavaScript object that contains key-value pairs that are used to scale UI elements from Windows to iOS. These properties allow you set the property values provided in Dp metrics to have the same UI view in both iOS and Windows platforms.

Generally, The UI view may vary across platforms when values are provided to the properties of the widgets in Dp. The Dots per Inch (DPI) and Pixels per Inch (PPI) values vary vastly for iOS and Windows. Due to this, for a given Dp value, the resultant UI is smaller on Windows compared to iOS.

Currently, the only supported key is `dpScaleFactor`. The value for the `dpScaleFactor` key is a JavaScript object that also contains key-value pairs. The supported keys are as follows.

| Constant | Value |
| --- | --- |
| referenceFontSize | An optional numeric value that specifies a value to scale the all font sizes. Set this parameter only in the pre-appinit and post-appinit. The parameter is applicable only for Windows (Phone). |
| referenceWidth | An optional numeric value that specifies the width of the target iOS device to which the Windows device screen has to be scaled. The default value of this parameter is the width of the Windows device screen in Dp. |

The resulting code for using the `dpScaleFactor` key would resemble the following.

```

function scaleWindowsToiOS()  
{  
    var scaleData = {};  
    scaleData.referenceWidth = 320;  
    scaleData.referenceFontSize = 0.8;  
    voltmx.application.setApplicationBehaviors({“dpScaleFactor”: scaleData});  
}
```

<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.application.setApplicationBadgeValue</summary>

* * *

This API allows you to set a badge value to an application icon on the mobile desktop at the top-right corner of the application icon. If you pass an empty string as a parameter, the badge applied on the application icon is removed.

### Syntax

```

voltmx.application.setApplicationBadgeValue([badgeValue](#badgeValue), [tileID](#tileID))
```

### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| badgeValue \[String\] - Mandatory | Value of the badge. The value that you specify in the badgeValue parameter appears within the badge. Do not pass any other value except a numerical value. For example, to set a badge value for an appicon, specify the value as "2" instead of 2. If the length of the badge value is greater than 1 the badge is a rounded rectangle. For example, if you specify the value of the badge as 88, the number appears in a rounded rectangular badge. If the length of the badge value is 1, the badge is always a circle. |
| tileID \[String\] - Optional | The tile ID defined for the secondary tile using the [setSecondaryTile](#setsecon) API. The parameter is applicable only for Windows. |


### Example

```

settingBadge: function() {
    this.view.btnBadge.setBadge("0", ""); //Set badge value on  button widget
    voltmx.application.setApplicationBadgeValue("" + 0);
},
BadgeIncrease: function() {
    var counter = voltmx.os.toNumber(this.view.btnBadge.getBadge()) + 1; // read badge value from button and increment it with 1 
    voltmx.print("this gets executed " + counter + "type is " + typeof(counter));
    this.view.btnBadge.setBadge("" + counter, ""); // Set badge value on the button widget
    voltmx.application.setApplicationBadgeValue("" + counter); //Set badge value on app icon
```

The badge appears as follows when you execute the code given above:

The dictionary object is a dictionary of value pairs and represents the context for request to be processed.This callback accepts the following arguments:**userInfo**\- **\[Dictionary\]** This parameter is mandatory. A dictionary of key value pairs.**replyObject**\- **\[JSObject\]**\- This parameter is mandatory. This object is used to send the response asynchronously. To send the response we should call a method (executeWithReply) on this JSObject. The method accepts a key value pairs that form the response to be sent back.//Sample code for onwatchrequest callback method.function jsfunction(userInfo, replyObj) {    if (userInfo.requestName == "getData"){      var responseDict={ "key1":"value1", "key2":"value2" };      replyObj.executeWithReply(responseDict);   }}> **_Note:_** It is possible to that execution of this call back might happen while the application is in the background. It is suggested to check the application state and perform UI updates in the phone application only when the application is running in the foreground.You may use getapplicationstate APIs. |
| onactivityrequest | This method is used to handle the handoff activity request that are sent to the application.This callback accepts the following arguments:**activityName** - **\[String\]** This parameter is mandatory. A string that represents the name of the activity.**activityInfo** - **\[Dictionary\]** This parameter is mandatory. A dictionary containing custom user information.This callback method returns a boolean (true/false) value that indicates the request handle status.//Sample code for onactivityrequest callback method. function jsfunction(activityName, activityInfo) {    if (activityName == "continueActivity") {       // use activityInfo dictionary to continue the past activity on the iPhone       return true;      }   return false; }  |
| onpreactivityrequest | This method is used to ask the receiving application, whether it wants to continue the handed off activity. If this callback method returns true, then the onactivityrequest callback method gets invoked where the receiving app gets a chance to continue the handed off activity.This callback accepts the following arguments:**activityName** - **\[String\]** This parameter is mandatory. A string that represents the name of the activity.If this callback method returns _true_, then the you notify the user that the receiving app wants to continue the activity on the device. If the callback method returns _false_, then iOS notifies the user to continue activity on the device.//Sample code for onpreactivityrequest callback method. function jsfunction(activityName) {    if (activityName == "continueActivity") {             return true;      }    return false; } |

<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.application.setApplicationInitializationEvents</summary>

* * *

This API is used to configure all initialization events such as, preappinit, postappinit, init, appservice, showstartupform and so on. The application lifecycle is as follows:  

> **_Important:_** This API must be invoked only once during the application lifecycle. You should NOT invoke this API as part of the application lifecycle, because Volt MX Iriswill generate the code that invokes the API automatically. Invoking this API multiple times will result in an undefined behavior.

![](resources/images/applifecycle_622x493.png)

### Syntax

```

voltmx.application.setApplicationInitializationEvents([callbacks](#callbacks2))
```

### Input Parameters

callbacks \[Object\] - Mandatory

Is a Hash table which comprises of the following key value pairs:

| Key | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **preappinit**\[params\] | This is an existing event that the developer registers in the IDE per application basis. This event consists of any logic that needs to be executed before the initialization of forms, skins, and any other application initialization activities. For e.g loading the i18n resource bundles dynamically etc. |
| **init**\[params\] | init is generated by the code and consists of the form and skin initialization data. |
| **postappinit**\[params\] | Is an existing event that the developer registers in the IDE per application basis. Developers use this function to define logic that needs to be executed before the first form is shown and after the application is initialized. > **_Note:_** postappinit can return a form handle. If postappinit returns a form handle, then the platform shows the form returned from the postappinit callback, otherwise the platform invokes the showstartupform function. |
| **appservice**\[params\] | The closure provided against appservice will be invoked by the platform in a sequence. This function also returns the form handle. > **_Note:_** appservice can return a form handle. If appservice returns a form handle, then the platform shows the form returned from the appservice callback. If appservice does not return a form handle, the platform invokes the showstartupform function. > **_Note:_** If both postappinit and appservice return the form handle then, the form returned by app service is given priority by the platforms. |
| **showstartupform**\[params\] | This is a method invoked by the platform to show the startup form, as indicated in the IDE. > **_Note:_** This event is invoked only when postappinit returns a nil. If appservice returns a form handle, showstartupform is not invoked. |
| **deeplink**\[params\] | This method is Thinclient/SPA specific and if appservice event is provided, then this event will be ignored. |


### Example

```

//onactive function 
function test() {
    alert("===============Test excuted=======");
}

//oninactive function
function test1() {
    alert("===============Test1 excuted=======");
}

//onbackground function 
function test2() {
    alert("===============Test2 excuted=======");
}

//onforeground function
function test3() {
    alert("===============Test3 excuted=======");
}

//onappterminate function
function test4() {
    alert("===============Test4 excuted=======");
}

//setAppInitialization function
function setAppInitializationEvents() {
    voltmx.application.setApplicationInitializationEvents({
        init: test,
        preappinit: test1,
        postappinit: test2,
        appservice: test3,
        showstartupform: test4,
        deeplink: test5
    });
    alert("===============setAppInitializationEvents excuted=======");
}
```

### Return Values

None

### Exceptions

*   **102** - InvalidInputError: An error is thrown if input is invalid.
*   **100**\- TypeError: An error is thrown when the type is invalid.

### Platform Availability

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.application.setApplicationLayout</summary>

* * *

This API specifies if the application must have a layout from "left to right" or "right to left".

### UseCase

To support Arabic kind of languages, all the widgets on a form must be layout from right to left. This API impacts only horizontal layout.

### Syntax

```

voltmx.applicationsetApplicationLayout([layoutDirection](#layoutDirection))
```

### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| layoutDirection \[Constant\] - Mandatory | Specifies the layout direction for the content and the widgets of an application. constants.APPLICATION\_LAYOUT\_RIGHT2LEFT constants.APPLICATION\_LAYOUT\_LEFT2RIGHT |

### Example

If an application supports English and Arabic languages, app developer can invoke below snippet anywhere in appservice or preappinit or postappinit.

```

function setApplicationLayoutBasedOnLocale() {
    if (voltmx.i18n.getCurrentLocale() == "en_US") {
        voltmx.application.setApplicationLayout(constants.APPLICATION_LAYOUT_LEFT2RIGHT);
    } else {
        voltmx.application.setApplicationLayout(constants.APPLICATION_LAYOUT_RIGHT2LEFT);
    }
}	
```

### Return Values

None

### Implementation Details

There is no direct API available to change the application layout to support both "Left2Right" and "Right2Left" languages. App developers have to spend huge amount of time in redesigning the UI for both locales, setting the margins/paddings and in setting "contentAlignment" for all widgets on all forms. This API is simple solution to change the application layout based on locale.

This API can be called in appservice/preappinit/postappinit after checking the current locale or this should be called after the locale is changed successfully with "setCurrentLocaleAsync()".

### Exceptions

An error is thrown if input is invalid or does not follow the expected structure.

*   102 - Invalid input error
*   101 - Insufficient arguments passed

### Platform Availability

Available on Windows.

* * *

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.application.setApplicationMode</summary>

* * *

This API enables you to set the application mode to Native, Hybrid, or Wrapper.

### Syntax

```

voltmx.application.setApplicationMode(Integer constant)
```

### Input Parameters

| Parameter | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Integer Constant | 1: constants.APPLICATION\_MODE\_NATIVE 2: constants.APPLICATION\_MODE\_HYBRID 3: constants.APPLICATION\_MODE\_WRAPPER |

### Example

```

function setApplicationMode(){
	voltmx.application.setApplicationMode(APPLICATION_MODE_NATIVE);
	
}
```

### Return Values

None

### Special Considerations

This API should be called only in preappinit or before the execution of preappinit. If this API is invoked elsewhere in the program, it is invalid and leads to undefined behavior.

### Exceptions

Error

### Platform Availability

Available on all platforms.

* * *

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.application.setApplicationProperties</summary>

* * *

The API enables you to set properties at the application level.

### Syntax

```

voltmx.application.setApplicationProperties(key-value pairs)
```

### Input Parameters

**statusBarColor**

Sets the color for a device's status bar.

**statusBarForegroundColor**

Sets the foreground color of a device's status bar; the color of each item (text, icon, and so on) displayed on the status bar. This parameter is not available on Android.

**statusBarHidden**

Hides or reveals the status bar.

You can achieve hidden status bar behavior by setting at Application level and at Form level as well. At the Application level, you can achieve the behavior by defining either statusBarHidden parameter, and also using the systemUiConfig parameter with value as IMMERSIVE\_STICKY\_HIDE\_STATUS\_BAR in the API.

When you define both statusBarHidden and systemUiConfig parameters in the API, the systemUiConfig parameter takes the precedence.

At the Form level, you can achieve the behavior using the [statusBarHidden](../../../Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/FlexForm_Properties.md#statusBa) property and the [systemUiConfig](../../../Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/FlexForm_Properties.md#systemUiConfig) property. The following table provides the precedence levels when hidden status bar behavior is set using both properties at the Form level and both parameters at the application level (only when the systemUiConfig parameter's value is IMMERSIVE\_STICKY\_HIDE\_STATUS\_BAR) as well.

> **_Note:_** The statusBarHidden flag is cleared when you move the application to the background and then bring it back to the foreground. So, the status bar is displayed by default when you move the application back to the foreground.

  
| Property/Parameter | Precedence Level |
| --- | --- |
| systemUiConfig Property (Form Level) | 1 |
| systemUiConfig Parameter (Application Level) | 2 |
| statusBarHidden Property (Form Level) | 3 |
| statusBarHidden Parameter (Application Level) | 4 |


### Example

```

Form.statusBarHidden : true
```

**statusBarStyle**

Sets a style for the status bar. This parameter is not available on Android.

For more information on the input parameters, refer the [status bar properties](../../../Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/FlexForm_Properties.md#statusBarColor).

**navigationBarColor**

Sets the color for a device's navigation bar. Applicable only for Android. For more information, refer to the [navigationBarColor property](../../../Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/FlexForm_Properties.md#navigationBarColor).

**systemUiConfig**

Controls the behavior of the status and navigation bars. Applicable only for Android. For more information, refer to the [systemUiConfig property](../../../Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/FlexForm_Properties.md#systemUiConfig).

You can define any one of the following:

|   |   |
| --- | --- |
| SYSTEM\_UI\_DEFAULT | Resets any of the following modes set previously. |
| DIM\_SYSTEM\_BARS | Dims the status and navigation bars, and space occupied them are retained as is. |

> **_Note:_** The systemUIConfig flag is cleared when you move the application to the background and then bring it back to the foreground. So, the status bar/navigation bar is displayed by default when you move the application back to the foreground.

### Example

```

function setApplicationProperties(){
  voltmx.application.setApplicationProperties({  
    "statusBarColor": "ffff0000",  
    "statusBarForegroundColor": "ff0000",  
    "statusBarHidden": true,  
    "statusBarStyle": constants.STATUS_BAR_STYLE_LIGHT_CONTENT,  
    "navigationBarColor" : ffff0000,  
    "systemUiConfig" : constants.HIDE_SYSTEM_BARS  
});	
}
```

### Return Values

None

### Special Considerations

The setApplicationProperties API is an application-level API and accepts key-value pairs as an input. When you set properties using the API to an application, the properties get applied to all the artifacts available in the application.

The properties can be applied at the application-level and at the form-level as well. When you set the properties to a form (form-level), the properties get applied only to that particular form in the visible region. When a user navigates to another form, the status and navigation bars may change based on the properties set to that form. Otherwise, the status and navigation bar behaves based on the properties set at the application-level. If the properties are set at both form level and application level, the properties set at the form level overrides the property set at the application level. If the properties are not set at the form-level and at the application-level, the device’s default settings are applied to status and navigation bars.

### Exceptions

Error

### Platform Availability

Available on all platforms.

Sets a flag indicating that the current form is ready to be cached for search engine optimization.

### Syntax

```

voltmx.application.setSeoDataReadyFlag()
```

### Example

```

// This function is added to the form.  
function seoReady() {  
voltmx.application.setSeoDataReadyFlag();
}
```

### Input Parameters

None.

### Return Values

None

### Remarks

By default, most forms in Volt MX Iris SPA web applications cannot be seen by web search spider robots when they crawl the web to index pages. For example, e Google robot crawls the web at regular intervals searching for web pages to index on servers all over the internet. When it encounters a Volt MX SPA web application, it will likely see only the first form. The content in other forms, which may be of significant value when users search the web, is not indexed.

To make Volt MX SPA web application content visible to search engines so that they can perform optimal searches, you can enable search engine optimization (SEO) for their apps, as described in the Volt MX IrisUser Guide. Calling `setSeoDataReadyFlag` for each form tells the Volt MX's SRO technology to cache the form for SEO.

You app should only call the `setSeoDataReadyFlag` function after all service call responses are processed, all required data is rendered, and the Volt MX Iris form is ready to be cached. A good time for your app to invoke the `setSeoDataReadyFlag` function is when it is processing the form's `postShow` event.

<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.application.startForegroundService</summary>

* * *

When invoked, this API starts a foreground service that runs continuously even when an application is running in the background, i.e. when the user is not directly interacting with the app.

The foreground services display notifications to send updates to the users. The notifications can be customized using [updateForegroundNotification](#updateForeground) API.

Foreground service can be started in scenarios which require your app to be actively running after being placed in the background or after turning the device's display off.

Some sample use cases include navigation while driving, tracing the path while running, and playing music. For more information, refer [here](https://developer.android.com/training/location/receive-location-updates#continue-user-initiated-action).

> **_Note:_** Ensure that you have done the following:

*   In the **androidbuild.properties** file, set the value of the `locationListenerType` property to `always`.  
    Appropriate entries are added to the **AndroidManifest.xml** file depending on the type of the location listener.
*   Enable the **Use Google Play Location Services** checkbox in the **Project Settings** > **Native** > **Android** section.
