=========

The Core Bluetooth is a framework used by the iOS apps to communicate with other devices inbuilt with Bluetooth wireless technology. For example, heart rate monitors and digital thermostats. With this feature, your iOS apps can interact, share data, perform some task and so on with other Bluetooth equipped devices.

The Bluetooth wireless technology embedded in the iOS devices is based on Bluetooth 4.0 specifications. This defines a set of protocols to enable communication between the devices.

Using the Bluetooth feature, the iOS applications can:

*   Scan for devices or peripherals equipped with Bluetooth.
*   Request to connect with the peripheral.
*   Interact with the peripheralâ€™s data.
