===========================================

Near Field Communication (NFC) is a technology that enables communication between smartphones and other devices up to a distance of 10 cm. The connection between NFC devices happens within a tenth of a second. NFC consumes less power. NFC-supported devices are indicated with NFC [Tags](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/advanced-nfc.md#tag-tech) or tickets.

> **_Important:_** This API is available on Android platform only.

Some uses of this technology are:

*   You can make payments with your smartphones without using any credit card or cash.
*   You can buy tickets.
*   You can share files, photos, or videos.

The data is stored in tags in a standard format. You can also store data in different formats. For more information on NFC, [click here](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/connectivity/nfc/index.md).
