The voltmx.screenrecorder namespace contains the following functions.


<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.screenrecorder.start</summary> 

* * *

You can use the _start_ API to initiate the recording of the screen. When this method is invoked, the web browser asks for permission to select the window, tab, or screen.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

voltmx.screenrecorder.start(config);
```

<b>Parameters</b>

_config_

The _config_ parameter consists of a JavaScript object. It contains the following attributes.

  
| Attributes | Description |
| --- | --- |
| framerate | Framerate is the number of consecutive images/ frames that appears on a screen per second. The default value is 30fps. This is an optional parameter. |
| onFailure | onFailure contains the callback that is invoked when an error occurs while recording, For example, this callback is invoked when the web browser does not support the screen recording feature. This is an optional parameter. |

The callback for the `onFailure` key must have the following signature.

onFailureCallback(err);

here, the `err` parameter is a string that contains the reason for the failure.

<b>Example</b>

```
config = {
 framerate: 24,
 onFailure: function(err) {  
//Sample code for onFailure callback, where err contains the error message.
  voltmx.print("Error :" + err);
 } 
};
voltmx.screenrecorder.start(config);
```

<b>Return Values</b>

None

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.screenrecorder.pause</summary>

You can use the _pause_ API to temporarily stop the recording of the screen. You can restart the recording process by using the [resume](#resume) API.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

voltmx.screenrecorder.pause();
```


<b>Parameters</b>

<b>Example</b>

```
 voltmx.screenrecorder.pause();	
```

<b>Return Values</b>

None

* * *

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.screenrecorder.resume</summary> 

* * *

You can use the _resume_ API to restart the screen recording after the [pause](#pause) API has been invoked.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

voltmx.screenrecorder.resume();
```

<b>Parameters</b>

None

<b>Example</b>

```
 voltmx.screenrecorder.resume();	
```

<b>Return Values</b>

None

* * *

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.screenrecorder.stop</summary> 

* * *

You can use the _stop_ API to end the screen recording. After the recording process is stopped, you can use the [getrecordeddata](#getrecordeddata) API to retrieve the Blob URL of the video.

<b>Syntax</b>

```

voltmx.screenrecorder.stop();
```


<b>Parameters</b>

None

<b>Example</b>

```
 voltmx.screenrecorder.stop();	
```

<b>Return Values</b>

None

<b>Remarks</b>

*   After you have invoked the stop API, invoke the [getrecordeddata](#getrecordeddata) API to retrieve the screen recording. If you invoke the [start](#start) API before invoking the getrecordeddata API, the new recording overrides the previous recording. The previous recording is not retained and you will lose the data.

* * *

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.screenrecorder.getrecordeddata</summary> 

* * *

You can use the _getrecordeddata_ API to retrieve the screen recording in the form of a Blob URL.

```

voltmx.screenrecorder.getrecordeddata();
```

<b>Parameters</b>

None

<b>Example</b>

```
var blob = voltmx.screenrecorder.getrecordeddata();
```

<b>Return Values</b>

Returns a Blob URL of the screen recording as a String.

> **_Note:_** In the Opera(v60) web browser, if you assign the Blob URL of the screen recording to the [source](../../../Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/Video_Basic_Properties.md#source) property of the Video widget, the recording may not start. This is because the Opera(v60) web browser has a technical limitation while playing an HTML5 video.

</details>
<details close markdown="block"><summary>voltmx.screenrecorder.getrecordedstate</summary> 

* * *

You can use the _getrecordedstate_ API to retrieve the current state of the screen recording.
