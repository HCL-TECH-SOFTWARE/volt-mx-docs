Navigation Object
=================

The `Navigation` object provides your app with the ability to navigate from form to form. It does this by navigating to a target form controller, which then displays the form's view. To create a Navigation object, your app must call the [voltmx.mvc.Navigatio](voltmx.mvc_Functions.md#Navigation)n function.
