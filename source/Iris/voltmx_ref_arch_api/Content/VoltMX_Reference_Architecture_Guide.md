Volt MX  Reference Architecture is an integrated set of development tools that enables you to build model-based apps and increase your code reuse. This architectural pattern lets designers, front-end app developers, and back-end service developers to work in parallel on the same app.

Volt MX  Reference Architecture also enables you to build apps that you can deploy across many hardware platforms more rapidly than by using the [traditional Freeform JavaScript application-development technique](../../../Iris/iris_user_guide/Content/CreateNewProject.md). Volt MX Reference Architecture provides a set of components and tools produced by HCL that enables you to create apps in a highly modular fashion.
