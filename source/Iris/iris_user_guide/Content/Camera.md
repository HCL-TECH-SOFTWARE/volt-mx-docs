------

Use a Camera widget to display a button that opens the device's native camera application to capture an image. By default, a saved image is stored as a PNG (Portable Network Graphics) image with the original size.

To learn how to use this widget programmatically, refer [VoltMX Iris Widget guide](../../../Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/Camera.md).

> **_Note:_** The Camera widget is not supported on SPA platforms.

### Look Properties

Look properties define the appearance of the widget. The following are the major properties you can set:

*   Whether the widget is visible.
*   The platforms on which the widget is rendered.
*   How the widget aligns with its parent widget and neighboring widgets.
*   If the widget displays content, where the content appears.

For descriptions of the properties available on the Look tab of the Properties pane, see [Look](Look.md#Flex).

### Skin Properties

Skin properties define a skin for the widget, including background color, borders, and shadows. If the widget includes text, you can also specify the text font.

For the Camera widget, you can apply a skin and its associated properties for the following states:

  
| Skin | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Normal | The default skin of the widget. |
| Focus | The skin applied when the widget has the focus. |
| Hover Skin | The look and feel of the widget when the cursor hovers over it. > **_Note:_** Hover skins are available only on the Windows (native) Tablet platform. |

For more information about applying skins, see [Understanding Skins and Themes](Customizing_the_Look_and_Feel_with_Skins.md).

### Camera Properties

Camera properties specify properties that are available on any platform supported by Volt MX Iris, and assign platform-specific properties.

> **_Note:_** In this section, the properties that can be forked are identified by an icon ![](Resources/Images/fork_-un.png) located to the left of the property. For more information, see [Fork a Widget Property](Forking.md#fork-a-widget-property).

#### Access Mode

Specifies how the captured image is stored.

Following are the options:

*   Public: The captured image is stored on the device and is accessible to all the applications on the device. For example, the captured images are accessible in ImageGallery.
*   Private: This is the default option for Windows. The captured image is stored on the device but is not accessible to any other application on the device and remains private to the application.
*   In-Memory: The captured camera image is stored in memory and is never written to disk. Captured images are lost when the application closes.

To specify the access mode, click the **Edit** button to open the **Access Mode** dialog box. To change the default access mode, select Default and then select an access mode from the value list. To specify a platform-specific access mode, select the platform and then select an access mode from the list.

#### Compression Level

For JPEG images, specifies the compression level with which a captured image is stored. The compression level determines picture quality. You can specify a compression level value between 0 (best picture quality) and 100 (low picture quality).

Default: 0

To specify the compression level, click **Edit** to open the **Compression Level** dialog box. To change the default compression level, select Default and then select a compression level from the value list. To specify a platform-specific compression level, select the platform and then select a compression level from the list.

### Actions

Actions define what happens when an event occurs. On a Camera widget, you can run an action when the following events occur:

*   onCapture: The action is triggered when the user captures a picture.
*   onTouchStart: The action is triggered when the user touches the touch surface. This event occurs asynchronously.
*   onTouchMove: The action is triggered when the touch moves on the touch surface continuously until movement ends. This event occurs asynchronously.
*   onTouchEnd: The action is triggered when the user touch is released from the touch surface. This event occurs asynchronously.
*   onFailure: The action is triggered when an error occurs using a Camera widget. For example, you set a camera source but it is not available on the device (iOS and Android).

For more information, see [Add Actions](working_with_Action_Editor.md).
