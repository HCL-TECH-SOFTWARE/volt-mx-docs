======================

Placeholders on forms and segments help a user to identify surfaces and possible actions for drag and drop in Iris.

**To turn on or off the Placeholder text, do the following**:

1.  In Volt MX Iris, open the project in which you want to make a change to the placeholder setting.
2.  From the File menu, navigate to **Eidt** > **Preferences** > **General**.
3.  Select or unselect **Show Placeholder Hints**.  
    The feature is turned on or off based on your selection.
