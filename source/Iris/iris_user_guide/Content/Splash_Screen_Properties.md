### Native iOS Configuration for Xcode Launch Storyboard

As Apple has deprecated support for Splash images from April 2020, support for creating and launching an Xcode Storyboard through Iris has been added from Visualizer V9 Fixpack3.

Volt MX  Iris has deprecated support for the iOS Splash screens. You must use the Launch Storyboard feature to configure splash screens for iOS devices. The launch storyboard feature supports all the existing functionality of the splash screen such as support for video, active indicator, and others. However, the Splash image that you set will not work.

Storyboards are flexible to any device orientation and any device size. Using the storyboard, you can design a splash screen by configuring the **UISupportedInterfaceOrientations** key with information about the supported orientations in the `infoplist_configuration.json` file.

> **_Important:_** These settings are equivalent to the app-level setting. If a specific orientation is mentioned here, and an unsupported orientation is mentioned at the form-level, the application may crash.

Here is an example for configuring the **infoplist\_configuration** file to support the Xcode Storyboard feature on an application setting level.

```
{
    "UISupportedInterfaceOrientations": [
        "UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait",
        "UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown",
        "UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft",
        "UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight"
    ]
}
```

*   If the application must only support portrait orientation, you must mention only the **UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait**, **UIInterfaceOrientationPortraitUpsideDown** values for iPad and { {**UIInterfaceOrientationPortrait**} } value for iPhone.
*   If the application must only support landscape orientation, you must mention only the **UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeLeft**, **UIInterfaceOrientationLandscapeRight** values for both iPhone and iPad.

> **_Note:_** If you do not configure the **UISupportedInterfaceOrientations** key, iPhone apps will support all device orientations other than the upside-down orientation, and iPad apps will support all device orientations, by default.

### Configure the Splash Screen for iOS Native Devices

As Apple has deprecated support for Splash images from April 2020, support to customize a Splash screen for the iOS Native channel has been added in Iris from Volt MX Iris V9 Fixpack 10. For the iOS Native channel, you can add widgets to the Splash screen, and also customize the properties for the widgets.

Volt MX  Iris has deprecated support for the iOS Splash images. You must use the Launch Storyboard feature to configure the splash screens for iOS devices. The launch storyboard feature supports all the existing functionality of the splash screen such as support for video, active indicator, and others. However, the Splash image that you set will not work.

> **_Note:_** If you import a project that was created in previous versions of Volt MX Iris, you must re-configure the Splash screen for the iOS Native channel.

For the iOS Native channel, in addition to the steps mentioned at [Configure the Splash Screen for the Mobile Channel](#configure-the-splash-screen-for-the-mobile-channel), you can configure the Background of the Form from the [Skin](#configure-the-skin-properties-of-the-splash-screen) tab, and also drag and drop the [Widgets from the Default Library](#add-widgets-from-the-default-library) onto the Form.

> **_Note:_** Currently, only the Image and Label widgets can be added to a Splash Screen Form.

#### Configure the Skin Properties of the Splash Screen

In the Background section of the Skins tab, from the Type drop-down list, select the type of background you want.

> **_Note:_** Background Type for the Splash Screen Skin only supports Single Color.

*   Click the square color icon to open the Color Palette window.  
    To select a particular hue, on the vertical color bar drag the two opposing arrows to the hue you want, and then change the hue’s lightness, darkness, and saturation by dragging to the desired location on the large color square. You can also assign a color by changing the RGB values, the HSB values, or pasting a hexadecimal value from another program into the **#** text box. To close the Color Palette window, click anywhere outside of it.
*   By default, the opacity is set to 100, making the background completely opaque with no transparency. However, if you want the background to have a degree of transparency, you can decrease its opacity. To do so, type a value between 0 and 100 in the Opacity text box, or drag the opacity slider to the degree of opacity that you want.

#### Add Widgets from the Default Library
