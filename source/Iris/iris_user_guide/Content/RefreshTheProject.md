===================

In the course of working on your project, you may have added resources or made changes that are not yet visually reflected in the various panes and tabs of Volt MX Iris. You can update the project to reflect these changes by refreshing it.

To refresh the project, do the following:

1.  On the **Project** menu, click **Refresh**.
2.  If your project has any unsaved files and you want to save those changes before refreshing, click **Yes** if prompted to save your changes. If you click **No**, the project will refresh and your changes will be lost.
