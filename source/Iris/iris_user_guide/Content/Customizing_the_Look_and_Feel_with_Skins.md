==============================

A widget’s appearance is defined by the skin that is applied to it. Every widget has a skin, even if it’s just the Volt MX Iris default skin. Skins give you the ability to establish visual continuity in your app. For instance, you may want all buttons in your app to use the same skin. Skins can also be applied depending on the state of a widget—for instance, when it’s at rest, receives focus, or is pressed. Several visual settings comprise a skin, such as the widget background color and opacity; the widget border color, opacity, size, and shape; the widget shadow settings; and in the case of certain widgets, font type, size, color, opacity, and shadow.

You can apply and manipulate skins in many different ways to meet your design needs, including editing, duplicating, copying and pasting, and forking. And by grouping skins together, you can create a theme that you can apply to widgets across the entire application.

You interact with widgets in two primary ways: on the widget level, using the Skins tab of an individual widget, and on a global level, using the Skins tab on the Project Explorer, where the skins of all widgets are listed.

Volt MX  Iris also provides a default theme that has a set of skins defined for all the widgets within an application. The skins in this theme can be applied to widgets to get a different look and feel for the widgets. Themes are accessed from the Skins tab of the Project Explorer.



The following topics describe how to work with skins and themes:

[Use Default Skins](#use-default-skins)

[Create a New Skin](#create-a-new-skin)

[Configure a New Skin](#configure-a-new-skin)

[Edit a Skin](#edit-a-skin)

[Apply a Skin](#apply-a-skin)

[Reuse Skins](#reuse-skins)

[Fork a Skin](#fork-a-skin)

[Delete a Skin](#delete-a-skin)

[Copy and Paste a Color or Gradient](Copy_and_Paste_a_Color.md)

[Using Themes - Applying a Collection of Skins as a Group](Using_Themes_Applying_a_Collection_of_Skins_as_a_Group.md)

Use Default Skins
-----------------

The default skins allow you to specify common skins for widgets in states like Normal and Focus. Normal state is the default look of the widget, and Focus state occurs when the user touches or clicks the widget in the application. With Volt MX Iris default skins, you can provide a uniform look and feel for the widgets across various platforms.

For example, if you specify btnSkinNormal as the Normal skin for Button in Themes, all the buttons in the application will use btnSkinNormal as the Normal Skin for buttons.

Though the Application themes define a common skin for a particular widget across the application, you can still specify a different skin for a widget by selecting a different skin under the widget properties.

To view the default skins navigate to Project Explorer and click the Skins tab.

Click on a widget to view the default forms.

Create a New Skin
-----------------

You can create as many skins in Volt MX Iris as you want so that you can achieve the balance between continuity and flexibility that your app design needs.

To create a new skin, do the following: 

1.  On the Project Explorer, click the **Skins** tab.
2.  On the **Skins** tab, locate the type of widget that you want to create the new skin for, such as a Button, and then click that widget type’s context menu arrow ![](Resources/Images/FormMenuArrow.png).
3.  From the menu, click **New Skin**, and then click the type of new skin you want to create. Many widget types offer just the standard Skin, while others also offer a Focus Skin, or some variation.

    ![](Resources/Images/CreateNewSkin_CRR.png)

Your new skin is created and is ready for you to configure.

Configure a New Skin
--------------------

Now that you have created a new skin, you need to configure its various properties with the look that you want. Here’s what you can do:

[Rename the Skin](#rename-the-skin)

[Set the Skin Background](#set-the-skin-background)

[Set the Skin Border](#set-the-skin-border)

[Set Individual Corners in Borders](#set-individual-corners-in-borders)

[Set the Skin Shadow](#set-the-skin-shadow)

[Set the Skin Font](#set-the-skin-font)

[Set the Skin Font Shadow](#set-the-skin-font-shadow)

### Rename the Skin

When you create a new skin, Volt MX Iris generates a unique name for it. And while you're welcome to keep the name that Volt MX Iris generates, you might find it more useful and easily recognizable if you rename it. You can rename widgets in two primary ways: using the Skins tab of an individual widget, and using the Skins tab on the Project Explorer, where the skins of all widgets are listed.

To rename a skin using the Skins tab on the Project Explorer, do the following:

1.  On the Project Explorer, click the **Skins** tab.
2.  On the **Skins** tab, locate the type of widget that the skin you want to rename is categorized under. If the skins currently don't appear under the type of widget, click the widget type to open the category and display the skins.
3.  From the list of skins, hover over the skin you want to rename and click its context menu arrow ![](Resources/Images/FormMenuArrow.png) to open the skin's context menu.
4.  From the skin's context menu, click **Rename**.
5.  Type a new name for the skin, and then press **Enter**.

To rename a skin using the Skins tab of an individual widget, do the following:

1.  On the Iris Canvas, locate a widget that's using the skin you want to rename, and then select it.
2.  in the Properties Editor, click the **Skins** tab.
3.  In the Name text box, type a new name for the skin, and then press **Enter**.

### Set the Skin Background

Volt MX  Iris gives you a variety of ways to configure the background of a skin, which are described in the following table.

> **_Note:_** Not all background options are available for all widgets.

<table style="width: 100%;mc-table-style: url('Resources/TableStyles/2015DefinitiveBasicTable.css');" class="TableStyle-2015DefinitiveBasicTable" cellspacing="0"><colgroup><col style="width: 136px;" class="TableStyle-2015DefinitiveBasicTable-Column-Column1"> <col class="TableStyle-2015DefinitiveBasicTable-Column-Column1"></colgroup><tbody><tr class="TableStyle-2015DefinitiveBasicTable-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-2015DefinitiveBasicTable-BodyE-Column1-Body1"><b>Background Type</b></td><td class="TableStyle-2015DefinitiveBasicTable-BodyD-Column1-Body1"><b>Description</b></td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-2015DefinitiveBasicTable-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-2015DefinitiveBasicTable-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Single Color</td><td class="TableStyle-2015DefinitiveBasicTable-BodyD-Column1-Body1">Applies a uniform, single color as the background of the skin that you choose.</td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-2015DefinitiveBasicTable-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-2015DefinitiveBasicTable-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Two Step Gradient</td><td class="TableStyle-2015DefinitiveBasicTable-BodyD-Column1-Body1">Applies two equally-applied colors as the background of the skin that you choose.</td></tr><tr class="TableStyle-2015DefinitiveBasicTable-Body-Body1"><td class="TableStyle-2015DefinitiveBasicTable-BodyE-Column1-Body1">Image</td><td class="TableStyle-2015DefinitiveBasicTable-BodyD-Column1-Body1">Applies an image of your choosing as the background of the skin.

#### SPA Borders

SPA borders can be applied when you have forked a form to the SPA platform. For more information, see [Forking a Form](Forking.md#forking-a-form).

  ![](Resources/Images/SPABorder.png)

You can modify the following border properties of a widget on an SPA platform:

1.  **Size**: When you fork a widget skin for an SPA platform, you can either set unique values for each side of the widget border or set the same value for all the border sides.
    
    To set unique values for each border side, follow these steps:
    
    1.  Click the left border icon (**|**). The icon changes from gray to blue.
    2.  Either type the value or using the slider, set the left border size.
    3.  Perform the above steps for all the border sides.
    
    To set identical values for all border sides, do the following:
    
    1.  Click the border indicator ![](Resources/Images/SPABorderUniform.png) . The indicator changes from grey to blue.
    2.  Either type the value or using the slider, set the uniform border values.
    
      > **_Note:_** Border values are not retained if you unfork a widget skin.
    
2.  **Color**: To modify the border color, do one of the following:
    *   Update the border color of the widget.
    *   Reuse an existing color. For more information, see [Copy and Paste a Color](Copy_and_Paste_a_Color.md).
3.  **Opacity**: Change how opaque or transparent the border color is.
4.  **Style**: When you define the border size, the Style property is enabled. The following types of styles are available for widgets:
    *   **Plain**: Widget corners have a standard, 90-degree angle.
    *   **Rounded Corner**: Widget corners are rounded rather than having a sharp, 90-degree angle. If you select this option, you can either set unique values for each corner of the widget border or set the same value for all the border corners.
        
        To set unique values for each corner, do the following:
        
        1.  Click the left-top corner icon (**![](Resources/Images/left_topborder.png)**). The icon changes from grey to blue.
        2.  Either type the value or using the slider, set the left-top corner size.
        3.  Perform the above steps for all the border corners.
        
        To set identical values for all border corners, do the following:
        
        1.  Click the corner indicator ![](Resources/Images/CornerStyle.png) . The indicator changes from grey to blue.
        2.  Either type the value or using the slider, set the uniform corner values.

### Set Individual Corners in Borders

Rounded edges can be applied for widgets on skins forked for Android and Windows native platforms.

  > **_Note:_** Android/Windows native platforms support configuring individual corner radius. Configuring border properties for each of the four edges of a given widget is not supported by Android/Windows native platforms.

   ![](Resources/Images/set_indvdl_corner_border.png)

**To set unique values for each corner, do the following:** 

1.  Click the border indicator ![](Resources/Images/SPABorderUniform.png) . The indicator changes from grey to blue.
2.  Either type the value or using the slider, set the uniform border values.
3.  Border values are not retained if you unfork a widget skin.
4.  Perform the above steps for all the border corners.

### Set the Skin Shadow

   ![](Resources/Images/shadow.png)

   > **_Note:_** Shadow feature is available only when a skin is forked.

You can modify the following shadow properties of a widget:

*   1.  **Dist X**: Denotes the horizontal shadow distance away from the widget. When a positive **Dist X** value is entered the shadow is moved to the right-side of a widget. When a negative value is entered the shadow is moved to the left-side of a widget.
    2.  **Dist Y**: Denotes the vertical shadow distance away from the widget. When a positive **Dist Y** value is entered, shadow is moved to the top-side of a widget. When a negative value is entered the shadow is moved to the bottom-side of a widget.
    3.  **Blur**: Denotes the shadow blur of the widget by allowing you to soften shadow.
    4.  **Color**: Denotes the color of the shadow. You can select a shadow color by clicking the **Color Picker**.
    5.  **InnerShadow**: Click this check box if you want the shadow to display inside the widget. Otherwise, clear the check box to display the shadows outside the widget.

### Set the Skin Font

You can modify the following font properties of a widget:

*   **Color**: Denotes the font color. To modify the font color, do one of the following:
    *   **Select a color.** To do so, click the square color icon to open the Color Palette window. To select a particular hue, on the vertical color bar drag the two opposing arrows to the hue you want, and then change the hue’s lightness, darkness, and saturation by dragging to the desired location on the large color square. You can also assign a color by changing the RGB values, the HSB values, or pasting a hexadecimal value from another program into the **#** text box. To close the Color Palette window, click anywhere outside of it.
    *   **Reuse an existing color.** For more information, see [Copy and Paste a Color or Gradient](Copy_and_Paste_a_Color.md).
*   **Opacity**: You can change the opacity level of the font color.
*   **Size**: You can set the font size by pixels (0 to 600) or as a percentage (0 to 600) of the baseline font size of 28 pixels.

   > **_Note:_** The Volt MX Iris framework, however, consumes only percentage-based values for font size. As the px values are purely representational, you must use percentage-based values while setting the skin's font size.

> **_Note:_** In iOS devices with OS 13, for certain font sizes, you will observe spacing.

*   **Font Family**: Click the **Edit** button of the **Font Family** property to open the **Font Names** window.
    
    ![](Resources/Images/fontFamily1.png)
    
    Here, you can select the fonts for individual platforms for both Mobile and Tables
    
*   **Font Family**: You can either assign a default font family for all platforms by selecting a font from the **Font Family** drop-down list, or assign a font by platform using the **Edit** button. In assigning fonts by platform, you can use either of the two following methods:
    
    | Assign a font to a single platform | Assign a font to multiple platforms |
    | --- | --- |
    | To assign a font to an individual platform, do the following: | To assign a font to multiple platforms, do the following: |

On the **Tablet** tab, select the required font for each of the native and SPA platforms. On the **Desktop** tab, select the required font for Web and Windows platforms. Click **Apply**.
    
     |
    
*   **Weight**: Select whether text on the widget should be normal or bold.
*   **Style**: Select whether text on the widget should be underlined or italicized.

### Set the Skin Font Shadow

Configure the text properties of a skin using Distance X, Distance Y, Blur, and Color properties -

   ![](Resources/Images/TextShadow_CRR.png)

> **_Note:_** The Text Shadow feature is available only for specific widgets such as Button, Label, and TextBox2.

You can modify the following text shadow properties of a widget:

1.  **DistX**: Denotes the horizontal shadow distance away from the widget text.
    *   A positive value places the text shadow to the right of the text.
    *   A negative value places the text shadow to the left of the text.
2.  **DistY**: Denotes the vertical shadow distance away from the widget.
    *   A positive value places the text shadow below the text.
    *   A negative value places the text shadow above the text.
3.  **Blur**: Denotes the shadow blur of the widget and allows you to soften text shadow.
4.  **Color**: Denotes the color of the text shadow. You can select a text shadow color by clicking the **Color Picker**.

### Location of Skin Files

Skins are grouped into a theme and the files are available in the themes folder in your application's workspace. See the following folder structure: 

\<Workspace\>\<your application name\>\<themes\>

For example, if your workspace is `C:/Users/your username/VoltMXIrisEWS` and your application name is `Application1`, then the themes are located at: `C:/Users/username/VoltMXIrisEWS/Application1/themes`.

Edit a Skin
-----------

To edit a skin you created in Volt MX Iris, do the following:

1.  Right-click the skin, and select **Edit As**.

     ![](Resources/Images/EditSkinOptions_CRR.png)

2.  Select an option from the menu. The options are: 
    1.  **Skin**: Skin of the widget when it is not focused.
    2.  **Menu Focus Skin**: Skin of the widget when it is focused by the user.
3.  Configure the skin as required.
4.  Save the skin. After you save the skin, a new skin file is created in Project Explorer. You can use this skin for widgets in your application.

Apply a Skin
------------

To apply a skin to a widget, do the following: 

1.  Select a widget from the Iris Canvas.
2.  In the Properties pane, click the Skins tab.
3.  Select the state of the widget that you want the skin to apply to, such as Normal or Focus.
4.  Click the Search icon to the right of the Name text box. The drop-down list that appears lists all the available skins. To filter out unwanted skins from the list, begin typing the name of the skin you want.
5.  From the drop-down list of skins, select the skin you want to use.
6.  Go to **Skins** tab.
7.  Navigate to your widget of choice.
8.  Right-click and select **Assign To > Skin / Focus Skin**. If you select **Skin**, the skin will be applied to the normal state of the widget. If you select **Focus Skin**, the skin will be applied to the focused state of the widget.

Reuse Skins
-----------

Skins can be used to display different views of widgets in different platforms.

![](Resources/Images/SkinsReusability_CRR.png)

*   **Import**: Allows you to import a CSS file to be used as skin. This action can be performed using CSS Hat plug-in and Adobe Photoshop. You can find the list of CSS elements supported for import [here](#supported-css-properties-for-import).
*   **Copy**: Allows you to copy the current skin of a widget to a clipboard.
*   **Paste**: Allows you to paste the copied skin to a selected widget.
*   > **_Note:_** Copying and pasting a skin creates another version of the original skin. The pasted skin becomes an independent skin. Any changes made to the original skin do not affect the pasted skin.
    
    > **_Note:_** The paste function can be applied across the widget states. For example, a Normal state skin of a Button Widget can be copied and pasted to the Focus skin state of the Button Widget.
    
*   **Assign**: Allows you to assign the copied skin to a widget.
*   **Duplicate**: Allows you to duplicate the current skin.

Differences between the Copy-Paste and Copy-Assign functions:

*   When a skin is copied and pasted, a new skin is created. However, when a skin is copied and assigned, no new skin is created.
*   Changes to the original skin do not affect the pasted skin. However, changes made to the original skin affects the assigned skin (because the copied and assigned skin are one and the same).

Fork a Skin
-----------

Through forking you can provide different values for the same skin across different platforms. However, only certain widget properties can be forked. You can identify if a property can be forked by the presence of a wishbone-shaped icon to the left of the property's name. Two types of forking are available:

**Simple Forking**. Fork one platform at a time.

**Complex Forking**. Forks multiple platforms of your choosing at the same time.

You can configure a skin and make it common to all platforms or apply it to a particular platform using the fork option in the **Properties > Skins** tab.

![](Resources/Images/SkinsTab_CRR.png)

To fork a skin, do the following: 

1.  From the Application Canvas, select the platform for which you want to fork.

     ![](Resources/Images/AppCanvas_CRR.png)

2.  In the Properties Editor on the **Skin** tab, in the General section, click the **Fork** icon to fork the skin for a selected platform. If the option is selected, the fork icon turns blue. The platform for which the skin is forked also appears at the platform.

    > **_Note:_** You can also go to the Skins tab in Project Explorer, and right-click a skin to fork the skin.

   ![](Resources/Images/ForkOptions_CRR.png)

3.  Click the lock icon to lock a skin. If you lock a skin, changes made to a widget's skin in one platform are applied to the remaining platforms.
4.  Click the ellipsis icon. The Fork Skin dialog appears.

    ![](Resources/Images/ForkSkinsDialog_CRR_421x233.png)

   > **_Note:_** For widgets like Calendar, which has the View Type property while forking. You can set the View Type property to different values.

 Select the platforms to fork and click **OK**. The skin will be forked for selected platforms.

### Important Considerations in Forking

*   Widgets that have background type as Multi-Step Gradient are by default forked (for example, Button and Phone Widgets).
*   When you fork and lock a widget skin, changes made to a widget's skin in one platform get applied to the remaining platforms, unless you specifically, unlock a platform.
*   To provide a unique skin for a platform, you apply fork and unlock properties for that platform.
*   By default all the widgets (except widgets that have background type as Multi-Step Gradient), will have a **Common** skin. Changes made to the Common skin will be applied across the platforms.
*   You can select the platforms to be forked by clicking the ellipsis button. From the **Fork Skin** dialog, select the desired platforms to be forked.

Delete a Skin
-------------

To delete a skin from the project library in Volt MX Iris, do the following: 

1.  Go to the **Skins** tab in the Project Explorer.
2.  Select the widget that has the skin you want to delete.
3.  Right-click the skin, and then click **Delete**.

      ![](Resources/Images/DeleteSkin_CRR.png)

4.  Select **Yes** in the confirmation window that appears. The selected skin is deleted.
