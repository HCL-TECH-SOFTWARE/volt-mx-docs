=============================================

For Desktop Web channel forms, you can display horizontal and vertical rulers to help you accurately position widgets. The rulers are available at a zoom level of 75% and higher. Guides are lines you pull from either ruler and position on the canvas to help you align widgets with one another. You can move guides, or lock them so that they're immovable, unlock them again, hide them, and remove them.

Rulers and guides are only available for the Desktop Web channel; they are not available for the Mobile, Tablet, and Watch channels.
