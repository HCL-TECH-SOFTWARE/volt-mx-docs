==========================================

Volt MX  Iris comes with a broad variety of native widgets.

The process for doing so varies by platform. For instructions on how to import and use third-party and custom widgets, choose from the following platforms:

[iOS](iOS_Custom_Widget.md)

[Android](Android_Custom_Widget.md)

[SPA and Desktop Web](SPA_Custom_Widget.md)
