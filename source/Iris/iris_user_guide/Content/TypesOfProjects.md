=================

In Volt MX Iris, you can choose the type of custom project you want to create when you select the **Project** menu in Volt MX Iris) to start the **New Project** wizard. You can also create a project based on pre-built sample applications and components.

In addition to creating a project from sample applications and components available on [HCL Forge](http://community.hclvoltmx.com/marketplace) , you can create the following types of custom projects:

*   **VoltMX Iris Reference Architecture.** A Volt MX Iris Reference Architecture project provides a framework to create a structured, modular digital application. It provides a controller to manage forms and templates as they are created. You can use RequireJS to load modules on demand. For information on creating a Volt MX Iris Reference Architecture project, see [Create a Volt MX Iris Reference Architecture Project](CreateKRAProject.md).
*   **Free Form JavaScript.** A Free Form JavaScript project lets you create a digital application without using an application development framework. For information on creating a Free Form JavaScript project, see [Create a Free Form JavaScript Project](CreateNewProject.md).
