Invoke a Service
----------------

The **Invoke Service** action is available under the **Network** category of Action Editor. You can also [search for this action](working_with_Action_Editor.md#search-for-an-action-in-action-editor) by typing _Invoke a Service_ in the Search box, on the left pane of Action Editor.

You can use the Invoke Service option to define an action sequence for invoking the following types of services:

*   [Identity](#invoke-an-identity-service)
*   [Integration](#invoke-an-integration-service)
*   [Orchestration](#invoke-an-orchestration-service)
*   [Object](#invoke-an-object-service)

When you add Invoke Service to an action sequence, all four types of services are displayed on the right pane of the Action Editor. In addition, the check boxes of all the service types are selected by default.

If you click the Search icon for the **Select Service** box, every service that is available in your Volt MX Foundry account is displayed in the search result.

![](Resources/Images/Invoke_Service_Search_861x388.png)

However, if you clear any service type check boxes and keep certain check boxes selected, a filtered list of services appears when you click the Search icon.

![](Resources/Images/Invoke_Service_FilteredSearch_885x398.png)

Consider a scenario where you have added the _MicrosoftActiveDirectory$login_ Identity service to the action sequence of a form or widget. If you then try to change the service of that same action sequence to another service (say, _MicrosoftActiveDirectory$logout_), Volt MX Iris displays a dialog box saying that all the data related to the _MicrosoftActiveDirectory$login_ service will be lost.

You can click **OK** to modify the service of the action sequence, or click **Cancel** to continue with the original service.
