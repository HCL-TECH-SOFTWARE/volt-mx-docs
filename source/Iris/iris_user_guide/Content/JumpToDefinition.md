========================================

As you're working on code, you can jump to the location where a given element of code is defined, such as a function or variable. Doing so expedites your coding by making it easy for you to identify a code element, such as what a particular function does.

To jump to the definition of a code element, do the following:

1.  Do one of these two actions:
    *   If you have a code module open such as a .js file, place the insertion point anywhere within the code element that you want to find the definition for. It isn't necessary to highlight the code element.
    *   If the definition you're seeking is for a function in the search results of the Search tab, click the function in the search results that you want to find the definition for.
2.  While holding down the **Alt** key, press the **period** key (i.e. **Alt + .**). Volt MX Iris opens the asset that contains the code element to the line number where the code element is defined.
