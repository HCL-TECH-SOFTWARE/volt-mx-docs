--------

Use a TextBox widget to enable a user to enter single line of text. For example, you can add TextBox widgets to the **Login** page of an application to enable users to enter their login credentials.

To learn how to use this widget programmatically, refer [VoltMX Iris Widget guide](../../../Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/TextBox.md).

### Look Properties

Look properties define the appearance of the widget. The following are the major properties you can set:

*   Whether the widget is visible.
*   The platforms on which the widget is rendered.
*   How the widget aligns with its parent widget and neighboring widgets.
*   If the widget displays content, where the content appears.

For descriptions of the properties available on the Look tab of the Properties pane, see [Look](Look.md#Flex).

### Skin Properties

Skin properties define a skin for the widget, including background color, borders, and shadows. If the widget includes text, you can also specify the text font.

For the TextBox widget, you can apply a skin and its associated properties for the following states:

  
| Skin | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Normal | The default skin of a widget. |
| Focus | The skin applied when the widget has the focus. |
| Blocked UI | The skin applied to block the interface until the action in progress (for example, a service call) is completed. > **_Note:_** The Blocked UI skin is available only for SPA platforms. |
| Placeholder | The skin applied to placeholder text in the widget. Only the font color skin attribute is applicable. |
| Hover Skin | Tthe look and feel of a widget when the cursor hovers over the widget. > **_Note:_** The Hover skin is available only on the Windows (native) Tablet platform. |

For more information about applying skins, see [Understanding Skins and Themes](Customizing_the_Look_and_Feel_with_Skins.md).

### TextBox Properties

TextBox properties specify properties that are available on any platform supported by Volt MX Iris, and assign platform-specific properties.

> **_Note:_** In this section, the properties that can be forked are identified by an icon ![](Resources/Images/fork_-un.png) located to the left of the property. For more information, see [Fork a Widget Property](Forking.md#fork-a-widget-property).

#### Pasteboard Type

Enables an application to share data within the application or with another application using system-wide or application-specific paste boards.

Typically, an object in the application writes data to a pasteboard when the user requests a copy or cut operation on a selection in the user interface. Another object in the same or different application then reads that data from the pasteboard and presents it to the user at a new location; this usually happens when the user requests a paste operation.

> **_Note:_** You can only paste the text to a text box with the same pasteboard type as that of the source textbox. For example, if you set the Pasteboard type as _App Level Persistent_ , you can paste the text only to another text box whose pasteboard type is also set to _App Level Persistent_ .

*   onDone: The action is triggered when the user has entered text and clicks or touches the action key.
*   onTouchStart: The action is triggered when the user touches the touch surface. This event occurs asynchronously.
*   onTouchMove: The action is triggered when the touch moves on the touch surface continuously until movement ends. This event occurs asynchronously.
*   onTouchEnd: The action is triggered when the user touch is released from the touch surface. This event occurs asynchronously.

*   onBeginEditing: The action is triggered when the user clicks within the text box to start editing (iOS, Android, and Single Page Application (SPA)).
*   onEndEditing: The action is triggered when the user the user ends the editing process by clicking on another widget or the **Done** button (iOS, Android, and Single Page Application (SPA)).
