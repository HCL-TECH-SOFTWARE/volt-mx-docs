===========================

**AndroidX** is the new and enhanced version of the [Android Support Library](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/support-library/index). [Android Pie](Android_Pie_Behavioral_Changes.md) is the final release for `android.support`; all new feature releases will be available in `androidx-packaged`.

In this document, we will explain about Volt MX Iris's AndroidX-supported plugins and the Jetifier flags that are automatically added in the `gradle.properties` file. Furthermore, we will discuss about the various issues that arise while you try to migrate your project to AndroidX and how to resolve these issues.

Automatic Addition of Jetifier FlagsÂ in gradle properties File
----------------------------------------------------------------

From V9 SP2, Volt MX has released AndroidX-supported plugins. As part of these plugins, the following Jetifier flags are specified in the `gradle.properties` file:

*   `android.useAndroidX=true`: The Android plugin uses the appropriate AndroidX library, instead of using a Support Library.
*   `android.enableJetifier=true`: The Android plugin automatically migrates existing third-party libraries (such as, JAR and AAR) to use AndroidX by rewriting their binaries.
    

> **_Important:_** After both these flags have been set, if the native Android project contains any references to the Android Support Library in its sources files and manifest entries, the command-line build will fail due to an Android Tools issue.

> **_Note:_** With Android Studio 3.2 and later, you can migrate an existing project to AndroidX by selecting **Refactor** > **Migrate to AndroidX** from the menu bar. This action converts all `android.support` references to `androidx`.

Issues while Migrating to AndroidX and their Resolutions
--------------------------------------------------------

While consuming VoltMX's AndroidX-supported plugins and migrating your project to AndroidX, you must manually replace any `android.support` references in the following scenarios:

*   **The plugins of a Cordova project or a React Native project that use** `android.support` **libraries.**  
    **Resolution**: In this scenario, you can use the following Cordova and ReactNative project folders and click the **Migrate to AndroidX** option in Android Studio to convert all `android.support` references to `androidx`:
    
    *   **Cordova**: Volt MX has provided you the control of the cordova `android` build folder (which gets generated during build time) to make the necessary changes. You can [manually customize the Cordova-generated Android project](CreateCordovaApplications.md#manually-customize-the-cordova-generated-android-project), [bundle this customized project](Native_App_Properties.md#bundle-a-customized-cordova-generated-android-project), and then check in the modified cordova `android` build folder. For more information about the details of this resolution, click [here](CreateCordovaApplications.md#ManuallyCustomizetheCordova-GeneratedAndroidProject).
    *   **ReactNative**: Because you already have control of the react-native `android` project folder, you can directly integrate the AndroidX-migrated project. This folder gets integrated into the Volt MX Iris project as a library project during build time.
*   **For** `android.support` **references in NFIs and Android manifest tag entries added through** Volt MX Iris**.**  
    **Resolution**: You must manually change all `android.support` references, and then build the application again.

Convert android.support References by using Jetifier Tool
-----------------------------------------------------------

1.  Search the JavaScript files, Android Manifest tag entries, and XML files for the occurrence of the `android.support` string.
2.  The Jetifier tool only accepts a .JAVA or .XML file as input. In accordance with this, copy all the `android.support` strings that you find to one file. For example, `supportstrings.java`.
3.  Click [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/jetifier) to download the Jetifier zip file from the **Install jetifier** section, and then extract it.

> **_Note:_** Your must install Java version 1.8 in your system to run the Jetifier standalone tool.

  4.  Go to the extracted folder > `bin` folder, and then run the 
      following command to get `androidx` equivalent references of `android.support` in the output file.  
       **\-i**: The input file with `android.support` references.  
       **\-o**: The output file where the equivalent `androidx` references are to be saved.

 ```
         jetifier-standalone -i <source-library> -o <output-library>

```

  5.  You can now use the contents of the `androidxstrings.java` 
       file to replace all the `android.support` references.
