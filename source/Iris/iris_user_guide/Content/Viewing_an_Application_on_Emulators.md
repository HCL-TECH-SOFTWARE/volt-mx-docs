==================================

After you create an application and build it, you can view it on a device emulator that you have set up using the resources of a given platform's SDK.

To view the application on an emulator, do the following:

1.  [Configure an emulator](Platform_SDKs.md) for the [platformThe operating system of a given device. iOS and Android are examples of platforms.](javascript:void(0);) and [channelDevice types available within a given platform. These include mobile (i.e. phone), tablet, and desktop.](javascript:void(0);) that you want to view the app on.
2.  [Build the application](BuildingAndViewAnApp.md).
3.  On the **Product** menu, point to **Launch Emulator**, and then select the emulator that you want to run.
4.  The emulator opens.  
    *   On an Android emulator, the application opens automatically.
