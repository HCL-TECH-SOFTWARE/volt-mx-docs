===============================

While working on code in the Code Editor, you can jump to a specific line number. This functionality is available for any code snippet or code file.

To jump to a specific line number, do the following:

1.  Press **Ctrl + L**. A command bar opens.
2.  In the **Jump to line** text box, type the line number you want to jump to, and then click **Go**. The insertion point jumps to the line number you specified.
