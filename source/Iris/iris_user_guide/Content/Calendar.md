---------------

Use a Calendar widget to display or select a date from a calendar. Click the calendar icon to select a date. The date and the calendar display in the format you specify. The icon does not appear on Mobile Web platforms .

To learn how to use this widget programmatically, refer [VoltMX Iris Widget guide](../../../Iris/iris_widget_prog_guide/Content/Calendar.md).

### Important Considerations

The following are important considerations for a Calendar widget:

*   If you do not specify an image, clicking the calendar icon displays the default calendar image.
    
*   By default, the Calendar widget occupies the complete width of its parent widget.
*   Clicking the calendar icon opens the current month calendar. On the Android platform, it is not possible to restrict the date selection between validStartDate and validEndDate with the native calendar view.

### Look Properties

Look properties define the appearance of the widget. The following are the major properties you can set:

*   Whether the widget is visible.
*   The platforms on which the widget is rendered.
*   How the widget aligns with its parent widget and neighboring widgets.
*   If the widget displays content, where the content appears.

For descriptions of the properties available on the Look tab of the Properties pane, see [Look](Look.md#Flex).

### Skin Properties

Skin properties define a skin for the widget, including background color, borders, and shadows. If the widget includes text, you can also specify the text font.

For a Calendar widget, you can apply a skin and its associated properties for the following states:

> **_Important:_** Custom border capability is now extended to iOS for the Calender widget.

  
| Skin | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Normal | The default skin of the widget. |
| Focus | The skin applied when the focus is on the widget. |
| Grid | The skin properties applied for the grid calendar. |
| Cell | The skin properties applied for the grid calendar cell. |
| Cell - Selected | The skin applied when a grid calendar cell is selected. |
| Cell - Focus | The skin applied when there is a focus on the grid calendar cell. |
| Cell - Today | The skin applied for the grid calendar today cell. |
| Cell -Weekend | The skin applied for the weekend days of a grid calendar. |
| Cell - Inactive | The skin applied for non-working inactive days of a grid calendar. |
| Done Button | The skin to be applied for Done button that appear on a calendar pop up. |
| Cancel Button | The skin to be applied for a Cancel button that appear on a calendar pop up. |
| Day | The day portion of the currently selected date. |
| Month | The month portion of the currently selected date. |
| Hover Skin | The look and feel of a widget when the cursor hovers over the widget. > **_Note:_** Hover Skin is available only on the Windows (native) Tablet platform. |

For more information about applying skins, see [Understanding Skins and Themes](Customizing_the_Look_and_Feel_with_Skins.md).
