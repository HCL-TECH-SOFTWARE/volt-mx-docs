====================

Volt MX  Iris provides you with a debugger to detect and diagnose errors in your applications.

You can debug apps in Volt MX Iris.

The debugger allows you to control the execution of your application by:

*   Setting breakpoints.
*   Suspending launched applications.
*   Stepping through your code.
*   Examining the contents of the variables and view them on an emulator.

The debugger has a client and server design. This design allows you to debug applications that are running remotely on the network as well as the applications running locally on your workstation.

Debugging an application involves building the application in debug mode (iOS or Android) and launching the application in an iOS or Android emulator or device. You can then use the Google Chrome debugger to debug the application. For information on using the Chrome debugger, see [Get Started with Debugging JavaScript in Chrome DevTools](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/javascript/) on the Google Chrome website.

See the following for information on debugging an application:

Debug JavaScript for iOS in Volt MX Iris
----------------------------------------------

### Volt MX Iris Classic

With Volt MX Iris, you can perform JavaScript debugging on connected Apple computers and devices. This procedure assumes that you have the Google Chrome web browser installed on your computer. You also need to install and run on your Mac the iOS WebKit Debug Proxy (ios\_webkit\_debug\_proxy). It must be version 1.6 or greater. To install this utility, from your Mac, open a terminal and enter the following command:

`brew install ios-webkit-debug-proxy`

> **_Important:_** You can debug JavaScript applications in iOS using the Volt MX Iris preview app on your device or on the simulator. The option to debug applications in iOS is available from **Preview** > **Debug** in Volt MX Iris .

> **_Important:_** If you are using a Windows machine to connect to a Mac machine for debugging, for iOS applications Functional Preview debugging, a URL will be generated in the console of Volt MX Iris. Ensure that you copy and paste the generated URL in your Chrome browser to start the debugging process.

> **_Important:_** Ensure that you deactivate and activate the breakpoint once your debugging starts in your Chrome browser. This is applicable for Windows and Mac machines.  

To debug JavaScript applications for iOS on a simulator or device:

1.  In Volt MX Iris, build your application for the [iOS](#build-and-launch-an-ios-application) platform in debug mode. To do so,  
    *   In Volt MX Iris, from the **Product** menu , click **Build**. In the Build dialog box, select Debug from the Build Mode drop-down list.
    *   In Volt MX Iris, from the **Build** menu, click **Build and Publish Native**. In the Build dialog box, select Debug from the Build Mode drop-down list.
