Preface
=======

As part of the Volt MX Foundry product, a set of standard application metrics are gathered, and a set of pre-built reports are made available to the end user.

These reports provide info about the Application activity, User activity, Geolocation, server requests, and performance.

The report data can be filtered using criteria, such as date range, environment, application, platform, and channel.

This document describes the standard reports and their use.

This document also describes the Volt MX Foundry analytics dashboard that provides an overview of the application activity at a glance. It provides a quick summary of information to view the state of the application.
