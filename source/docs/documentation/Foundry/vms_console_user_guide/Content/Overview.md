Preface
=======

Volt MX  Foundry has multiple features that can be used - Identity, Integration, Orchestration, Sync, and Engagement Services. These features can be accessed through a common, centralized console. For successful authentication with users, and to access the centralized features of Volt MX Foundry, HCL recommends that you install the following Volt MX Foundry features on premises:

*   Volt MX Foundry Identity and Console
*   Volt MX Foundry Integration
*   Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services

Volt MX  Foundry Engagement Services provides generic notification service that allows you to send push notifications, email, SMS and passes to mobile devices running on different platforms (for example, iPhone, Android, Windows, and Web).

Enterprises can use Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services to send notifications to applications. In general, push notifications are alert notifications. They are sent only to those applications, which are subscribed to Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services. The subscribed applications may have different set of audiences. Using Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services, a user can also define the message target. For example, a banking enterprise uses Volt MX Foundry Engagement Services to send promotional offer as notifications to its Retail Banking application. In this case, end-users who have installed the retail banking applications (and also subscribed to retail banking application) on their mobile device receive the promotional offer in the form of a push notification.

Volt MX  Foundry Engagement Services also has an additional feature of enhancing the messaging channel. This is through the capability to send campaign messages and event messages as push notifications. For more details on campaigns and events, refer the [Introduction](Introduction.html) section.
