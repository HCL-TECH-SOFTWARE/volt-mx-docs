Preface
=======

Volt MX  Foundry is a Mobile Back-end as a Service (MBaaS) provider that helps developers build native and web apps for mobile. Various back-end services are easily integrated with the application irrespective of whether the application is built using JavaScript, PhoneGap, iOS, or Android frameworks.

Volt MX  Foundry allows you to define the back-end to build native mobile apps for iOS, Android, and HTML5-based apps for modern browsers. Volt MX Foundry ensures that developers build mobile applications quickly by focusing on core areas and obtaining secured back-end services instantly. Volt MX Foundry has multiple features that can be used - Identity, Integration, Orchestration, Objects, Sync, and Engagement Services. These features can be accessed through a common, centralized console.
