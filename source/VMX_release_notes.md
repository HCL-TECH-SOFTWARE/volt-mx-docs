    - voltmx.constants.DOMAIN_STATE_NONE

- A new action, **ACTION_APP_OPEN_BY_DEFAULT_SETTINGS**, has been added in the [voltmx.application.openSettings API](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/voltmx.application_functions.html#voltmx.app6) to open the Default Settings Screen, where a user can associate an app with a Domain.

- Support has been added for the [voltmx.automation.webSocket.sendMessage](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/voltmx.automation_namespace.html#volt-mx-automation-namespace) and the [voltmx.automation.webSocket.waitForMessage](https://opensource.hcltechsw.com/volt-mx-docs/docs/documentation/Iris/iris_api_dev_guide/content/voltmx.automation_namespace.html#volt-mx-automation-namespace) APIs in Volt MX Iris to support cross-app testing between apps that use the same WebSocket Server.

### V9 Servicepack 2 Fixpack 46
July 5, 2022

#### Iris Enhancements

Starting with Mac OS Monterey version 12.3, Apple has removed Python 2.7 as being bundled by default. This version of Python is required for iOS builds from Iris.
