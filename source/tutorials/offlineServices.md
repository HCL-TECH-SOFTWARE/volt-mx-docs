# Offline Services

Offline objects and Sync provide features that you can use to enable your apps to work even without network connectivity. Offline Objects allows the device to download object data that it can use for its services, the device can later sync this data with Volt MX Foundry. Sync provides services that help in collaborating the data between devices and backend systems even if the device goes offline.
