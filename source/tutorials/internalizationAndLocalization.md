# Internationalization and Localization

The process of designing or developing an application in such a way that it supports various languages and regions is referred to as Internationalization, also known as i18n. In Volt MX Iris, the i18n features make it possible to build your app for various language locales without making changes to the application code or logic. By setting up the locales that you want to support and then adding what amounts to a vocabulary list for each locale, your app can become functional in multiple languages.
